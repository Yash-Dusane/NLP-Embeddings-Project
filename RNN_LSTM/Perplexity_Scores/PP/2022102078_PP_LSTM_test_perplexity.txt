140.42123108371055
But I
cannot--I have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly
bestowed it most unwillingly.	94.3341
It is from my cousin, Mr. Collins, who, when I am dead,
may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases."	50.2060
On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls,
whose eagerness for their cousin's appearance would not allow them to
wait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen her
for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower.	113.5568
The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits,
in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the
greatest share.	222.4110
"For my own part," she rejoined, "I must confess that I never could see
any beauty in her.	43.9936
It cannot be for _me_, it cannot be for _my_ sake
that his manners are thus softened.	55.5553
"Certainly," he replied, biting his lips.	38.3669
She had fully proposed being
engaged by Wickham for those very dances:--and to have Mr. Collins
instead!	312.0699
"I leave it to yourself to determine," said Mr. Bennet.	46.8000
She asked her at different times, how many sisters
she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of
them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they
had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her
mother's maiden name?--Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her
questions, but answered them very composedly.--Lady Catherine then
observed,

"Your father's estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think.	191.1169
_His_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned
towards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship after a
while shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not
scruple to call out,

"What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam?	165.8900
Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday;
     and not a note, not a line, did I receive in the mean time.	194.2908
"I think you said she was a widow, sir?	54.4121
1.F.1.	18.1890
Two days after Mr. Bennet's return, as Jane and Elizabeth were walking
together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the housekeeper
coming towards them, and, concluding that she came to call them to their
mother, went forward to meet her; but, instead of the expected summons,
when they approached her, she said to Miss Bennet, "I beg your pardon,
madam, for interrupting you, but I was in hopes you might have got some
good news from town, so I took the liberty of coming to ask."	115.7109
"Is this," thought Elizabeth, "meant for me?"	57.5343
CHAPTER II.	6.6303
At one time she had almost resolved on applying to
him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application, and
at length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr. Darcy would never
have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of his
cousin's corroboration.	91.1039
That will make thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room at
table for him."	126.9761
Society has claims on us all; and I profess myself one of those who
consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for every
body."	578.4982
I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world,
and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns."	116.0795
He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to any one else.	41.3313
She has no
money, no connections, nothing that can tempt him to--she is lost for
ever."	93.0348
I shall go distracted."	150.8782
Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey,
and as she did not answer them all herself, attention was necessary,
which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a mind so
occupied, she might have forgotten where she was.	127.6926
Four weeks were to pass away
before her uncle and aunt's arrival.	49.4228
Mr. Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, "_You_ cannot
have a right to such very strong local attachment.	44.7705
He, who had always inspired in herself a respect
which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open
pleasantry.	405.0904
She directly replied,

"You need not be frightened.	70.4799
Mrs. Reynolds informed them, that it had been taken in his
father's life time.	43.0115
"You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!--always wanting me
to play and sing before any body and every body!--If my vanity had taken
a musical turn, you would have been invaluable, but as it is, I would
really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of
hearing the very best performers."	161.8298
_You_ wish to think all the
world respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of any body.	66.2215
She became jealous of his esteem, when she could no
longer hope to be benefited by it.	58.3897
"This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening, in
summer; the windows are full west."	118.8472
From their infancy,
they have been intended for each other.	63.2562
And now here's Mr. Bennet gone away, and I know he will fight
Wickham, wherever he meets him, and then he will be killed, and what is
to become of us all?	185.6465
"Lizzy is
only headstrong in such matters as these.	227.8013
This was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted
only regimentals to make him completely charming.	212.2189
how ardently did she long to know, whether any of his were directed in a
like manner.	202.1265
Elizabeth could not help saying, "It is
very much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think so."	30.8956
He bore it however with admirable calmness.	96.2901
When my niece Georgiana went to
Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of her having two men servants go
with her.--Miss Darcy, the daughter of Mr. Darcy, of Pemberley, and Lady
Anne, could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner.--I
am excessively attentive to all those things.	156.5142
Mrs. Bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of.	279.5644
- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.	68.2991
A report of a most
alarming nature, reached me two days ago.	104.6766
Four nieces
of Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and
it was but the other day, that I recommended another young person, who
was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite
delighted with her.	140.3088
He walked away again
immediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of
mind; Charlotte tried to console her.	97.8000
The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she
would, and the argument ended only with the visit.	250.1591
She shall hear my opinion."	31.1798
He who, she had been
persuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this
accidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance, and without
any indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where
their two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good opinion
of her friends, and bent on making her known to his sister.	138.6556
Do not involve
yourself, or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of
fortune would make so very imprudent.	86.7772
if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in
Derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not
much better.	136.4638
I have certainly meant well through the whole affair.	57.7808
On the strength of Darcy's regard Bingley had the
firmest reliance, and of his judgment the highest opinion.	150.7717
"I will make no promise of the kind."	35.6795
I hope they will not meet at all.	21.9923
He is nothing to us, you know, and I am sure
_I_ never want to see him again.	19.6662
"I have not the smallest objection to explaining them," said he, as soon
as she allowed him to speak.	46.1964
Miss
Bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the
first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility,

"Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ----shire militia removed from Meryton?	141.9036
"Oh, yes!--of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt.	76.8296
Upon this information, they instantly passed through the hall once more,
and ran across the lawn after their father, who was deliberately
pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock.	201.3486
"My dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these.	57.3647
Her
disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her
sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could
never be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious, as
Bingley had now been gone a week, and nothing was heard of his return.	199.1820
You must
give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment of
believing what I say.	61.6490
I will not encourage
the impudence of either, by receiving them at Longbourn."	53.4130
In future, I hope we shall be always of one
mind."	82.4640
"Obstinate, headstrong girl!	4512.4252
I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner,
     representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done, and
     all the unhappiness she had brought on her family.	84.8910
It will pass away soon enough."	38.7932
Wickham of course wanted more
     than he could get; but at length was reduced to be reasonable.	140.6982
I
did not expect such a compliment."	17.6339
I wonder who first
discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!"	522.2716
He
then said,

"I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me
exceedingly.	97.9800
Something he supposed might be attributed
to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so much
attention in the whole course of his life.	69.7671
Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related.	190.1087
yes.--Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Philips be
placed in the gallery at Pemberley.	142.3938
But there
are two things that I want very much to know:--one is, how much money
your uncle has laid down, to bring it about; and the other, how I am
ever to pay him."	97.9309
In a few minutes, Mrs. Bennet half opened the door and called out,

"Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you."	47.3823
"I should never have considered the distance as one of the _advantages_
of the match," cried Elizabeth.	34.0677
The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning; and Mr. Collins having
been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was
able to bring home the pleasing intelligence, of their appearing in very
good health, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the
melancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings.	151.2479
The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of Mrs.
Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first tumult of joy
was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the
while.	139.8755
After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss
Bingley's appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all
attended her into the breakfast parlour.	114.5201

Transcriber's note:

      Text enclosed by underscores is in italics (_italics_).	601.4579
And this consideration leads me moreover to
     reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last
     November, for had it been otherwise, I must have been involved in
     all your sorrow and disgrace.	209.1560
said Jane.	14.9943

"That is an
uncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it would
be a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintance.	103.1229
Putting
away the letter immediately and forcing a smile, she said,

"I did not know before that you ever walked this way."	98.4583
His consenting to marry
her is a proof, I will believe, that he is come to a right way of
thinking.	87.9715
Does she live near you, sir?"	308.8504
His words
seemed to imply it.	52.4485
With _your_
good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of
others!	163.2390
"If!	35.8137
He inquired how far
Netherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in
an hesitating manner how long Mr. Darcy had been staying there.	203.1712
He expressed no regret for what he had
done which satisfied her; his style was not penitent, but haughty.	139.9130
After
sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour, without hearing Miss
Bingley's voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold
enquiry after the health of her family.	98.2928
A great deal more passed at the
other table.	47.0525

[Illustration: MATLOCK]




PRIDE AND PREJUDICE:

A Novel.	169.9454
The gentleman experienced some change of
feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and,
glancing over it, said, in a colder voice,

"Are you pleased with Kent?"	163.0526
In every thing else she is as
good natured a girl as ever lived.	92.2058
But I wonder how long you
_would_ have gone on, if you had been left to yourself.	58.5874
From the entrance hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with a
rapturous air, the fine proportion and finished ornaments, they followed
the servants through an anti-chamber, to the room where Lady Catherine,
her daughter, and Mrs. Jenkinson were sitting.--Her Ladyship, with great
condescension, arose to receive them; and as Mrs. Collins had settled it
with her husband that the office of introduction should be her's, it was
performed in a proper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks
which he would have thought necessary.	315.7549
He _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety, but his
countenance expressed real security.	163.2442
You are to understand, Miss Bennet, that I came here
with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will I be
dissuaded from it.	134.7799
And even Mary could assure her family
that she had no disinclination for it.	76.3996
As they passed into other rooms, these objects were
taking different positions; but from every window there were beauties to
be seen.	416.4857
My father and mother believe the worst,
     but I cannot think so ill of him.	37.3467
The evening passed quietly, unmarked by any thing extraordinary.	50.8679
How was that possible?	50.3012
We must not
all expect Jane's good fortune."	51.1690
"In what an amiable light does this place him!"	248.8248
Such was Miss Lucas's scheme; and appearances were so
favourable that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost
sure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon.	126.0137
"But it is not merely this affair," she continued, "on which my dislike
is founded.	90.6311
This cannot be!--engaged to Mr. Darcy!	51.7464
Mr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt's ill breeding, and made
no answer.	50.4574
How are you all?"	114.5166
Did you see him while you were at Lambton?	69.9554
Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and
Elizabeth sorry for her, and sorry for her father's speech, was afraid
her anxiety had done no good.--Others of the party were now applied to.	100.1881
No, Lizzy, let me once in my life feel how much I have
been to blame.	70.9156
His apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over,
he was the admirer of some one else.	125.6554
"I have no right to give _my_ opinion," said Wickham, "as to his being
agreeable or otherwise.	51.2686
"Mr.
Collins moreover adds," "I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia's sad
business has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their
living together before the marriage took place, should be so generally
known.	215.8972
Well, he certainly is
very agreeable, and I give you leave to like him.	38.4621
I have heard you mention them with consideration
these twenty years at least."	134.5967
"Sir, you quite misunderstand me," said Mrs. Bennet, alarmed.	173.6468
Come, let me see the list of the pitiful fellows
who have been kept aloof by Lydia's folly."	1043.5196
From
what can it proceed?	248.4616
On Saturday he came again.	53.3262
"I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness;
or me either, for that matter.	136.5280
Can his most intimate friends be so
excessively deceived in him?	416.6326
"True," said Mr. Bennet, "but it is a comfort to think that, whatever of
that kind may befal you, you have an affectionate mother who will always
make the most of it."	73.7894
I must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain
from declaring my amazement, at hearing that you received the young
couple into your house as soon as they were married.	152.2743
The next morning, as she was going down stairs, she was met by her
father, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand.	31.6585
But he is, beyond all comparison,
the most agreeable man I ever saw--and if he becomes really attached to
me--I believe it will be better that he should not.	116.9673
She
could not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper,
wrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what
Lydia had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been
intended.	170.7952
Dear me!	18.8514
"How could I ever think her like her nephew?"	62.4405
His pride, in that direction,
may be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must deter
him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by.	142.5667
I suppose she had
nothing particular to say to you, Lizzy?"	52.5454
With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity,
Elizabeth opened the letter, and to her still increasing wonder,
perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper, written
quite through, in a very close hand.--The envelope itself was likewise
full.--Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it.	736.2385
cried Elizabeth.	13.9626
Mr. Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed.	178.5314
In the absence of Jane,
he always attached himself to Elizabeth, for the pleasure of talking of
her; and when Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same means of
relief.	85.9219
"But how did he account for
it?"	97.0321
They were confined for the evening at different tables, and she had
nothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side
of the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.	82.0205
He must go
     somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew he should have
     nothing to live on.	47.2316
His doing so
drew her notice.	76.3010
Our
importance, our respectability in the world, must be affected by the
wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark
Lydia's character.	186.9828
My visit was
not long, as Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were going out.	34.4865
She was of great use and comfort to us all, and lady
Lucas has been very kind; she walked here on Wednesday morning to
condole with us, and offered her services, or any of her daughters, if
they could be of use to us."	95.3626
"If it was to be secret," said Jane, "say not another word on the
subject.	37.8549
Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was
dispatched to Longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay, and bring
back a supply of clothes.	273.7887
Consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her
husband's incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her
neighbours might all see Mr. Bingley in consequence of it, before _they_
did.	136.2744
I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very
glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my
hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls; though
I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy."	114.3281
CHAPTER IX.	6.6303
"I do not believe a word of it, my dear.	15.1909
Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to
the utmost to speak with composure when she said,

"You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your
declaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared me the
concern which I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a
more gentleman-like manner."	208.5481
Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her
affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already
self-destined to another.	291.4922
"Yes; he introduced us to his sister."	39.1254
In comparing her recollection of Pemberley, with the
minute description which Wickham could give, and in bestowing her
tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor, she was
delighting both him and herself.	136.2366
No, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if I have very
good luck, I may meet with another Mr. Collins in time."	73.3541
What a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that the
proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago, would now
have been gladly and gratefully received!	185.3075
In
confirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary
transactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming
her authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.	171.4961
He was declared to be in debt
to every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues, all honoured with
the title of seduction, had been extended into every tradesman's family.	127.7867
In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on
nothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the letter
was unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she could, she
again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham, and
commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence.	159.0286
It has been my own doing,
and I ought to feel it."	27.7271
"La!	25.1770
It was rather small, but well built and convenient; and every
thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of
which Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit.	554.8998
Charlotte says, she hardly ever does.	79.3630
They agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure of the
family, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman's conduct;
but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern,
and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen
to go away, just as they were all getting so intimate together.	99.0264
When is your turn to come?	55.3413
I have not been at all able to account
for the honour of seeing you here."	32.0818
In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to
Meryton and see how every body went on; but Elizabeth steadily opposed
the scheme.	125.0036
When the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card tables
were placed.	54.3315
When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go; and very
unwillingly said so.	255.2180
how acutely did she now
feel it.	245.1282
Yet, indeed, I am
in earnest.	35.4315
"I do not know.	8.4108
"Tell me once for all, are you engaged to him?"	80.1611
In
a fortnight they were to go, and once gone, she hoped there could be
nothing more to plague her on his account.	88.7536
Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for
her authority proceeded; but it was not in her power to give any
information of so satisfactory a nature, as the compliment deserved.	153.4782
You will hardly bear to be
long outdone by Jane.	32.3081
It does not necessarily follow that a deep,
intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours."	603.3696
she cried.	12.2887
cried he, turning towards her.	28.1029
Mrs. Bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take some
refreshment; but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not very politely,
declined eating any thing; and then rising up, said to Elizabeth,

"Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness
on one side of your lawn.	108.2314
It was a subject, in short, on
which reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing.	125.3986
This invaluable friend was a
very young woman, and very lately married.	193.9658
The
eldest of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven,
was Elizabeth's intimate friend.	158.1507
--said Jane as she
finished it.	56.5325
"But my father cannot.--He wrote last week to hurry my return."	120.9261
They will then join his regiment,
     unless they are first invited to Longbourn; and I understand from
     Mrs. Gardiner, that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all,
     before she leaves the South.	82.9482
"Not at all," was her answer; "but depend upon it, he means to be severe
on us, and our surest way of disappointing him, will be to ask nothing
about it."	75.8837
We will go round the Park every day.	47.6039
How odious I should think them!"	48.1640
Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back
the praise on her sister's warm affection.	295.5455
I know you will contrive it all."	187.7052
My father is going to
     London with Colonel Forster instantly, to try to discover her.	60.1970
When he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant
information of what was going on, and their uncle promised, at parting,
to prevail on Mr. Bennet to return to Longbourn, as soon as he could, to
the great consolation of his sister, who considered it as the only
security for her husband's not being killed in a duel.	128.3697
I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you have been spared
     something of these distressing scenes; but now as the first shock
     is over, shall I own that I long for your return?	324.6700
"No," said her father, "Wickham's a fool, if he takes her with a
farthing less than ten thousand pounds.	54.5790
It distressed her a little, and she was
quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the
Parsonage.	94.1617
Be assured, my dear Sir, that Mrs. Collins and
     myself sincerely sympathise with you, and all your respectable
     family, in your present distress, which must be of the bitterest
     kind, because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove.	144.6132
"And we mean to treat you all," added Lydia; "but you must lend us the
money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there."	118.6524
For a few moments, indeed,
she felt that he would probably strike into some other path.	51.1377
All connection between us seemed now dissolved.	210.2869
"I am sure _I_ know none so handsome; but in the gallery up stairs you
will see a finer, larger picture of him than this.	156.1935
Nothing could be more delightful!	56.3640
"It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married,"
continued her mother, "but at the same time, Mr. Bingley, it is very
hard to have her taken such a way from me.	52.5592
The improvement of
spending a night in London was added in time, and the plan became
perfect as plan could be.	185.0645
It convinced her, that
accident only could discover to Mr. Bingley her sister's being in town.	97.1103
"How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions
in speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy, for now they _do_ appear wholly
undeserved."	272.5111
She sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to
lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her
sister, as the servant was approaching the door.	164.9911
I fancy, Lizzy, that obstinacy is the real
     defect of his character after all.	351.7359
Wickham, Lydia, were all forgotten.	55.3654
Has
he, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?"	92.6144
We have judged it best, that my
     niece should be married from this house, of which I hope you will
     approve.	79.2288
and to see dear Wickham too!	184.5903
The certainty of
meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that
might not unreasonably have alarmed her.	176.1583
"But that expression of 'violently in love' is so hackneyed, so
doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea.	76.5984
We were
married, you know, at St. Clement's, because Wickham's lodgings were in
that parish.	133.0618
I am particularly unlucky
in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character, in a
part of the world, where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree
of credit.	69.5663
"Both," replied Elizabeth archly; "for I have always seen a great
similarity in the turn of our minds.--We are each of an unsocial,
taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say
something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to
posterity with all the eclat of a proverb."	125.6613
CHAPTER XVIII.	6.6303
The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.	90.7296
I am extremely
     glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at
     Hunsford.	151.3967
Wickham's affection for Lydia, was just what Elizabeth had expected to
find it; not equal to Lydia's for him.	66.6520
He was well, but so much
engaged with Mr. Darcy, that they scarcely ever saw him.	32.5770
He had
done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem.	77.3757
As that was the
case, neither Jane, to whom I related the whole, nor I, thought it
necessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could it
apparently be to any one, that the good opinion which all the
neighbourhood had of him, should then be overthrown?	213.6522
How can they suit each other?--Do you
know Mr.	177.5746
repeated Mr. Bennet.	19.0232
A scheme of which every part promises delight, can
never be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by
the defence of some little peculiar vexation."	635.8470
If I have wounded your sister's
     feelings, it was unknowingly done; and though the motives which
     governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient, I have
     not yet learnt to condemn them.--With respect to that other, more
     weighty accusation, of having injured Mr. Wickham, I can only
     refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my
     family.	188.3781
I thought I
understood from the Gardiners that you had."	83.4179
The sight of
Miss Lucas was odious to her.	20.1418
She
had ventured only one glance at Darcy.	96.6433
Besides, it will not much signify what
one wears this summer, after the ----shire have left Meryton, and they
are going in a fortnight."	114.2805
Darcy."	11.8994
"Oh!	6.3514
I do not remember her name among the ladies at
court."	55.0731
He took leave
of his relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished
his fair cousins health and happiness again, and promised their father
another letter of thanks.	255.7851
My dear Jane, I am in
such a flutter, that I am sure I can't write; so I will dictate, and you
write for me.	47.7408
"Of whom does Jane ever think ill?	312.3976
"Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp,
and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful
little design for a table, and I think it infinitely superior to Miss
Grantley's."	117.0451
I cannot find
out that I hate her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to think
her a very good sort of girl.	47.3938
He was her dear Wickham on every
occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him.	194.1878
"I did not know before," continued Bingley immediately, "that you were a
studier of character.	44.2052
Miss Bingley is to live with her brother and keep
his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming
neighbour in her."	56.5635
I wish you very happy and very rich, and by
refusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise.	81.2274
To Pemberley, therefore, they were to go.	30.4333
All that I can promise you, therefore, is not
to be in a hurry.	29.6094
Mr. Bennet's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such
as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for
it gratified him, he said, to discover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he had
been used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and
more foolish than his daughter!	114.4610
"That is to say, you had given your permission.	41.9658
What will become of me.	25.4702
My uncle and aunt and I were to go together; and the others
were to meet us at the church.	53.4605
I do not trust my own
partiality.	22.2064
I am most seriously displeased."	511.0812
"You know nothing of the matter.	18.4208
When the engagement was for home, some of the officers always
made part of it, of which officers Mr. Wickham was sure to be one; and
on these occasions, Mrs. Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth's
warm commendation of him, narrowly observed them both.	156.3737
He owed a good deal in
the town, but his debts of honour were still more formidable.	92.2600
"No, no.	27.5413
Was not this some excuse for incivility, if I _was_ uncivil?	428.0753
The rest of his letter is only about his dear Charlotte's
situation, and his expectation of a young olive-branch.	62.5731
Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him."	24.5563
Resignation to
inevitable evils is the duty of us all; the peculiar duty of a young man
who has been so fortunate as I have been in early preferment; and I
trust I am resigned.	338.2300
This is the estimation in which you hold me!	122.4582
it is very hard to think
that she might have been Mr. Collins's wife by this time, had not it
been for her own perverseness.	47.5943
"Oh!	6.3514
He saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia.	49.1134
"You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to deny me
the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the
amusement in general, he can have no objection, I am sure, to oblige us
for one half hour."	89.4211
Darcy!--There
is nothing like dancing after all.--I consider it as one of the first
refinements of polished societies."	122.9728
Collins."	42.1171
I am
     sure you will be very comfortable there.	20.3467
"Yes, or I will never see her again."	22.0104
Darcy mentioned his letter.	39.3336
Not that
I care about it, though.	80.4903
I cannot think so very ill of
Wickham.	23.4293
It was possible, however,
that some of his companions in the ----shire, might be able to give more
information; and, though she was not very sanguine in expecting it, the
application was a something to look forward to.	82.3366
It
gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in
no cheerful humour.	297.1399
"I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time.	43.1545
Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt.	69.4805
"But you _will_ know it, when I have told you what happened the very
next day."	48.7166
CHAPTER IX.	6.6303
Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she said
less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness;
nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable.	188.5074
Four sides of paper were
insufficient to contain all her delight, and all her earnest desire of
being loved by her sister.	135.2107
I had not
believed it possible."	34.2694
"Mrs. Annesley is with her.	59.5180
"You have only proved by this," cried Elizabeth, "that Mr. Bingley did
not do justice to his own disposition.	38.0240
It
was all pride and insolence.	23.2631
VOL.	17.4247
"Yes, in conjunction with his friend."	20.0857
Unwilling as she
was to admit an idea so destructive of Jane's happiness, and so
dishonourable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its
frequently recurring.	193.3103
I _will_ leave him to himself."	21.4185
Bingley intended it likewise, and
sometimes made choice of his county; but as he was now provided with a
good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those
who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the
remainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to
purchase.	138.0464
Elizabeth had
not before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat down,
resolving within herself, to draw no limits in future to the impudence
of an impudent man.	219.9136
Darcy_, you see, is the man!	37.8029
My reasons for
believing it are briefly these:--It does not appear to me that my hand
is unworthy your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer would
be any other than highly desirable.	260.1012
You must contrive to send
somebody.	63.5831
I hope I never ridicule what is wise or good.	113.5381
I know it all; that the young man's marrying her, was a
patched-up business, at the expence of your father and uncles.	104.1023
It is not that I do not believe _my_ fingers as
capable as any other woman's of superior execution."	151.8399
Never mind Miss
Lizzy's hair."	368.5106
CHAPTER IV.	6.6303
"Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do not
know."	33.7738
They were forced to conclude, that he had no pleasing intelligence to
send, but even of _that_ they would have been glad to be certain.	46.3519
"A man who has once been refused!	130.1439
that he should have been in love with her for
so many months!	28.0746
She really
looked almost wild."	115.4096
"You take an eager interest in that gentleman's concerns," said Darcy in
a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.	152.5099
What relates to yourself, is as follows.	58.3907
1.B.	18.1890
In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion,
with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and the
improvements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the
gentlemen joined them; and he found in Mrs. Philips a very attentive
listener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she
heard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as
soon as she could.	117.3426
"It must have been his sister's doing.	24.8611
Elizabeth
was surprised, however, that Wickham should consent to such a scheme,
and, had she consulted only her own inclination, any meeting with him
would have been the last object of her wishes.	62.2731
"Oh!	6.3514
"We have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there
twice!--How much I shall have to tell!"	245.5566
Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley's attentions to her sister, Elizabeth
was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some
interest in the eyes of his friend.	123.5896
Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence would give
pleasure; and instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliest
emotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world.	108.3811
He resigned all
     claim to assistance in the church, were it possible that he could
     ever be in a situation to receive it, and accepted in return three
     thousand pounds.	98.0372
She continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of Lady
Catherine's carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter
Charlotte's observation, and hurried her away to her room.	151.6947
"Do you talk by rule then, while you are dancing?"	374.5591
Good girl!	102.9613
"Oh!	6.3514
He spoke well, but there were feelings besides
those of the heart to be detailed, and he was not more eloquent on the
subject of tenderness than of pride.	91.2222
"His manners are very different from his cousin's."	45.0886
He has not an ill-natured
look.	51.9657
"I am trying to make it out."	16.3434
This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared; and
she could hardly suppress a smile, at his being now seeking the
acquaintance of some of those very people, against whom his pride had
revolted, in his offer to herself.	109.5554
As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its
contents.	102.3093
The
upstart pretensions of a young woman without family, connections, or
fortune.	185.5010
Those to her mother, contained little else, than that
they were just returned from the library, where such and such officers
had attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as
made her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which
she would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a
violent hurry, as Mrs. Forster called her, and they were going to the
camp;--and from her correspondence with her sister, there was still less
to be learnt--for her letters to Kitty, though rather longer, were much
too full of lines under the words to be made public.	146.1553
He cannot know what Mr.
Darcy is."	21.4303
Some people call him proud; but I am sure I never
saw any thing of it.	57.0390
After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth could not
help reverting once more to the first, and saying,

"I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley!	109.5159
Now be sincere;
did you admire me for my impertinence?"	179.0308
Generous, good man, I am afraid he has
distressed himself.	124.6879
"Indeed you are mistaken.	40.8339
Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party.--"I assure
you, I feel it exceedingly," said Lady Catherine; "I believe nobody
feels the loss of friends so much as I do.	92.7871
There was no one therefore who could be pointed out,
as likely to give any news of him.	57.0889
"True.	21.3358
He
found her as handsome as she had been last year; as good natured, and as
unaffected, though not quite so chatty.	75.4880
"Indeed, Mr. Bennet," said she, "it is very hard to think that Charlotte
Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that I should be forced to
make way for _her_, and live to see her take my place in it!"	47.3177
It is settled between us already, that
we are to be the happiest couple in the world.	58.4557
CHAPTER XIX.	6.6303
Indeed, Eliza, you will be
as welcome to me as either of them."	42.8361
They attacked him
in various ways; with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and
distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all; and they were at
last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour
Lady Lucas.	250.7621
If there is no
other objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall certainly not be
kept from it, by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry
Miss De Bourgh.	49.0064
Come be quick, be quick!	238.3506
"Such as vanity and pride."	106.4599
Mr. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.	45.3555
Now was the
moment for her resolution to be executed, and, while her courage was
high, she immediately said,

"Mr. Darcy, I am a very selfish creature; and, for the sake of giving
relief to my own feelings, care not how much I may be wounding your's.	90.9836
I am
going away myself."	27.6284
"Some time or other he _will_ be--but it shall not be by _me_.	57.2325
I shall be back by dinner."	39.4957
"And they _must_ marry!	41.1399
Two of her
girls had been on the point of marriage, and after all there was nothing
in it.	41.5130
cried Lydia.	22.1111
Let me take it
in the best light, in the light in which it may be understood."	70.3566
"I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be
no want of subject.--We may compare our different opinions."	172.4485
Miss Bingley
succeeded no less in the real object of her civility; Mr. Darcy looked
up.	82.1528
"He could be still amiable, still pleasing, to my uncle and aunt, when
he was in town; and why not to me?	54.6593
what does he say?	84.9947
Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his
friend.	85.3477
No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she
had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him,
that could be so called.	116.0896
"I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me; when we met at
Pemberley.	55.5777
To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused, and
whose merit she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive
information, he was the person, to whom the whole family were indebted
for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an
interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just, as
what Jane felt for Bingley.	110.2240
Do not let us
quarrel about the past.	62.9430
"Can it be
possible that he will marry her?"	94.6063
"And this is always the way with him," she added.--"Whatever
can give his sister any pleasure, is sure to be done in a moment.	77.3896
The whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr. Bennet the next
morning, but the post came in without bringing a single line from him.	74.6766
Mr. Darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on
together.	30.6592
Lady Lucas herself
has often said so, and envied me Jane's beauty.	278.2345
When Mrs. Bennet was told of this, she did
not express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering
what her anxiety for his life had been before.	73.5997
"Well," cried Elizabeth, "have it as you choose.	51.0267
"You have insulted me, in every possible method.	50.2129
After wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every
variety of thought; re-considering events, determining probabilities,
and reconciling herself as well as she could, to a change so sudden and
so important, fatigue, and a recollection of her long absence, made her
at length return home; and she entered the house with the wish of
appearing cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such
reflections as must make her unfit for conversation.	341.0798
She had always felt that Charlotte's opinion of matrimony
was not exactly like her own, but she could not have supposed it
possible that when called into action, she would have sacrificed every
better feeling to worldly advantage.	102.2831
"If your master would marry, you might see more of him."	47.5000
Most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, and
seek to clear one, without involving the other.	120.7530
Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them
mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no
real confidence could ever subsist between them again.	268.4628
At first there
seemed danger of Lydia's engrossing him entirely, for she was a most
determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets,
she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets
and exclaiming after prizes, to have attention for any one in
particular.	255.6575
Elizabeth however did not chuse to
take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the
consequence of any reply.	111.5490
Oh, Lydia!"	23.4129
She was received, however, very politely by them;
and in their brother's manners there was something better than
politeness; there was good humour and kindness.--Mr.	85.3711
Mr. Collins was also in the same state of angry pride.	46.0982
"I shall be very fit to see Jane--which is all I want."	52.0313
CHAPTER XVI.	6.6303
This was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet, and, therefore, instead of
making any answer, she went on as before,

"I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate.	47.3409
"Yes, always," she replied, without knowing what she said, for her
thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared
by her suddenly exclaiming, "I remember hearing you once say, Mr. Darcy,
that you hardly ever forgave, that your resentment once created was
unappeasable.	137.2784
The fishing scheme had been
renewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of his meeting
some of the gentlemen at Pemberley by noon.	372.6261
But really, Ma'am, I think it would be very hard upon
younger sisters, that they should not have their share of society and
amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to
marry early.--The last born has as good a right to the pleasures of
youth, as the first.	169.3569
It would have been strange if they had.	51.7941
Almost as
soon as I entered the house I singled you out as the companion of my
future life.	206.3019
"But what," said she, after a pause, "can have been his motive?--what
can have induced him to behave so cruelly?"	140.5413
Mrs. Collins,
seeing that she was really unwell, did not press her to go, and as much
as possible prevented her husband from pressing her, but Mr. Collins
could not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine's being rather
displeased by her staying at home.	160.9148
Mr. Collins was gratified; and with a more smiling
solemnity replied,

"It gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your
time not disagreeably.	129.3120
Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with
all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry.	159.9641
To all the
objections I have already urged, I have still another to add.	104.6622
The idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away
with by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing that she could not
use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther, and
he continued:

"My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for
every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example
of matrimony in his parish.	177.2805
Colonel Forster is a sensible man, and will
keep her out of any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an
object of prey to any body.	142.9837
He looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but with a moment's
recollection and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly seen
him often; and after observing that he was a very gentleman-like man,
asked her how she had liked him.	348.3596
Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to it when Mr.
Collins first came to Hunsford."	28.8548
CHAPTER XII.	6.6303
Both sisters were uncomfortable
enough.	87.6500
He was writing, and, without raising his head,
coolly replied,

"Just as you please."	65.5155
Upon this signal, the youngest of
her daughters put herself forward.	133.4374

Allowing for the common demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was
therefore at leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to
hear him, though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to
be told, the history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy.	49.7492
I told him, moreover, that I believed myself
mistaken in supposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferent
to him; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was
unabated, I felt no doubt of their happiness together."	58.6962
Vain,
ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrouled!	379.6635
Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of
her stay, as they had been at first.	78.8638
Her ladyship was highly incensed.	68.7623
That lady I suppose is your mother."	57.1750
His character sunk on every
review of it; and as a punishment for him, as well as a possible
advantage to Jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr.
Darcy's sister, as, by Wickham's account, she would make him abundantly
regret what he had thrown away.	197.5626
It is a pity that great ladies
in general are not more like her.	108.7264
"These are home questions--and perhaps I cannot say that I have
experienced many hardships of that nature.	100.5497
Darcy?"	18.1457
And what sort of table do they keep?	279.0546
"From what we have seen of him," continued Mrs. Gardiner, "I really
should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by
any body, as he has done by poor Wickham.	78.8765
Mr. Collins had a compliment, and an allusion to throw in here, which
were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter.	101.6206
"Only think of its being three months," she cried, "since I went away;
it seems but a fortnight I declare; and yet there have been things
enough happened in the time.	110.8950
Nor was Darcy's vindication, though
grateful to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery.	208.2525
"Well girls," said she, as soon as they were left to themselves, "What
say you to the day?	62.8239
An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already had
Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her
housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all.	420.7293
The walk being here less
sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before they
met.	204.5652
His behaviour to her sister was such, during dinner time, as shewed an
admiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded
Elizabeth, that if left wholly to himself, Jane's happiness, and his
own, would be speedily secured.	151.0265
But his pride, his abominable pride, his
shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to Jane, his
unpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though he could not justify it,
and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr. Wickham, his
cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon overcame the
pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited.	189.5760
When she was only fifteen, there was a gentleman at my
brother Gardiner's in town, so much in love with her, that my
sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away.	65.0787
In the first place, she persisted in disbelieving
the whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr. Collins
had been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be happy
together; and fourthly, that the match might be broken off.	76.0671
It is because he will not give himself the trouble."	43.6535
Mrs. Wickham!	26.8986
Let me advise you then, my dear Sir,
     to console yourself as much as possible, to throw off your unworthy
     child from your affection for ever, and leave her to reap the
     fruits of her own heinous offence.	204.0275
"It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it."	89.3094
But tell me, what did you come down to
Netherfield for?	59.9226
Good gracious!	21.9956
A deeper shade of hauteur overspread his
features, but he said not a word, and Elizabeth, though blaming herself
for her own weakness, could not go on.	148.1312
Mrs. Philips's vulgarity was another, and perhaps a greater tax on his
forbearance; and though Mrs. Philips, as well as her sister, stood in
too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley's good
humour encouraged, yet, whenever she _did_ speak, she must be vulgar.	310.8526
"Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?"	350.2722
"It does seem, and it is most shocking indeed," replied Elizabeth, with
tears in her eyes, "that a sister's sense of decency and virtue in such
a point should admit of doubt.	118.1020
Mr. Darcy, who never looks at any
woman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at _you_ in
his life!	80.1652
She was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee cup
himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying,

"Is your sister at Pemberley still?"	155.2137
who have
often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified my
vanity, in useless or blameable distrust.--How humiliating is this
discovery!--Yet, how just a humiliation!--Had I been in love, I could
not have been more wretchedly blind.	1115.1127
Elizabeth found herself
quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her
composedly.--Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with
strongly-marked features, which might once have been handsome.	263.4130
They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do not
like at all; and in her air altogether, there is a self-sufficiency
without fashion, which is intolerable."	206.3775
She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been
mistaken.	87.5640
Darcy was fixed in astonishment.	31.1118
I do not know of any
other designs that he had formed: but he was in such a hurry to be gone,
and his spirits so greatly discomposed, that I had difficulty in finding
out even so much as this."	115.8344

He knows of my
     being in town, I am certain, from something she said herself; and
     yet it should seem by her manner of talking, as if she wanted to
     persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy.	60.8619
How you must have hated me after _that_ evening?"	86.7244
"I would not on any
account trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow her to hear it
from any one but myself.	224.8050
And you may be certain that when I have the honour of
seeing her again I shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty,
economy, and other amiable qualifications."	73.5839
He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant.	69.4582
Bingley was the principal spokesman, and Miss Bennet the
principal object.	52.6257
She could not yet recover from the
surprise of what had happened; it was impossible to think of any thing
else, and totally indisposed for employment, she resolved soon after
breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise.	137.8286
Mr. Darcy's letter, she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart.	58.4447
I cannot
catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their
concerns, as I often see done."	107.7380
But, Lizzy, you can tell
us whether it is like or not."	87.9208
"Yes; but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing.	270.2166
But I shall not scruple to assert, that the serenity
     of your sister's countenance and air was such, as might have given
     the most acute observer, a conviction that, however amiable her
     temper, her heart was not likely to be easily touched.--That I was
     desirous of believing her indifferent is certain,--but I will
     venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually
     influenced by my hopes or fears.--I did not believe her to be
     indifferent because I wished it;--I believed it on impartial
     conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason.--My objections to
     the marriage were not merely those, which I last night acknowledged
     to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside, in my
     own case; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to
     my friend as to me.--But there were other causes of
     repugnance;--causes which, though still existing, and existing to
     an equal degree in both instances, I had myself endeavoured to
     forget, because they were not immediately before me.--These causes
     must be stated, though briefly.--The situation of your mother's
     family, though objectionable, was nothing in comparison of that
     total want of propriety so frequently, so almost uniformly betrayed
     by herself, by your three younger sisters, and occasionally even by
     your father.--Pardon me.--It pains me to offend you.	259.2216
Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a
slight inclination of the head.	50.5139
Darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth
tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again.	609.1797
The insipidity and yet the noise; the
nothingness and yet the self-importance of all these people!--What would
I give to hear your strictures on them!"	221.4306
For my part, I am inclined to believe it all Mr.
Darcy's, but you shall do as you chuse."	42.6385
Elizabeth preserved as steady a
silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too
much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of "Lord,
how tired I am!"	216.3418
Miss Bingley moved with alacrity to
the piano-forte, and after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead
the way, which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she
seated herself.	120.6632
A resemblance in good humour
and good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other, and out of
their _three_ months' acquaintance they had been intimate _two_.	146.8259
Yet he knew to the contrary himself.	69.3292
"Yes; I do comprehend a great deal in it."	44.0814
"I am sorry to hear _that_; but why did not you tell me so before?	41.5671
Mr. Darcy replied with great intrepidity,

"Miss Elizabeth Bennet."	52.6908
Elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such
coarseness of _expression_ herself, the coarseness of the _sentiment_
was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied
liberal!	363.1612
Elizabeth replied that it was.	25.6558

Rendered
spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours, he had yielded to
his brother-in-law's intreaty that he would return to his family, and
leave it to him to do, whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable
for continuing their pursuit.	211.1647
But, alas!	21.6075
But in such cases as these,
a good memory is unpardonable.	134.1266
I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first
object.	37.8441
"How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!"	48.1875
"An easy distance do you call it?	149.5288
cried Mrs. Gardiner, whose curiosity
as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.	119.3359
But here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my
sister's absence, I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of
pleasure realized.	125.1670
how he must have felt it!"	33.8535
Colonel Fitzwilliam had called
at the parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr. Darcy they had
only seen at church.	52.1144
She felt it so; and though, in
looking forward, neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity,
could be justly expected for her sister; in looking back to what they
had feared, only two hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they
had gained.	192.7117
has she any family?"	229.5491
But wishes were vain; or at best could serve only to amuse her in the
hurry and confusion of the following hour.	361.4556
Allow me to say, Lady Catherine, that the arguments with
which you have supported this extraordinary application, have been as
frivolous as the application was ill-judged.	216.7416
We have reason to imagine
that his aunt, lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look on the match with
a friendly eye."	37.5346
If I was to go through the world, I could not
meet with a better.	29.4099
Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection,
but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her.	121.3960
Not a word passed
between the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went to bed in
the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless Mr. Darcy
returned within the stated time.	249.6454
"Is my father in town?"	36.3978
I do assure you that I am not
one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so
daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second
time.	88.0391
There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for
Mr. Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of
his uncle, Lord ---- and to the great surprise of all the party, when
Mr. Collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him.	124.3064
In Darcy's presence she dared not mention Wickham's name; but Elizabeth
instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the
various recollections connected with him gave her a moment's distress;
but, exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she
presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone.	251.1760
I had narrowly observed her during the two visits
which I had lately made her here; and I was convinced of her affection."	129.6938
His accompanying them was a double advantage; she felt all the
compliment it offered to herself, and it was most acceptable as an
occasion of introducing him to her father and mother.	149.1985
At that moment they were met from another walk, by Mrs. Hurst and
Elizabeth herself.	67.2618
At length, every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a few
moments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and took
leave.	82.1897
He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as
Elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book.	331.8554
Your uncle is as much surprised as I am--and nothing
     but the belief of your being a party concerned, would have allowed
     him to act as he has done.	62.6826
If _I_ can
perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton indeed not to
discover it too."	68.2487
His resentment was in proportion to the distress of his
     circumstances--and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me
     to others, as in his reproaches to myself.	121.2441
we had such a good piece
of fun the other day at Colonel Forster's.	128.0930
At length, however, our
     kind friend procured the wished-for direction.	254.3622
He replied, and was again silent.	33.2140
"Though it is difficult," said Jane, "to guess in what way he can mean
to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to his
credit."	299.1883
Mr. Wickham is the son of a very
     respectable man, who had for many years the management of all the
     Pemberley estates; and whose good conduct in the discharge of his
     trust, naturally inclined my father to be of service to him, and on
     George Wickham, who was his god-son, his kindness was therefore
     liberally bestowed.	226.3769
Is not it so, Mrs.	52.7256
He danced
only four dances!	162.9109
Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley,
and that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy, without
calling her attention.	90.3026
"How can you be smiling so,
Lizzy?"	124.1988
His surprise was great.	63.1437
He shall not be in love with me, if I
can prevent it."	25.0492
And
     will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances
     to his creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin a list,
     according to his information.	416.3049
The congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received
from Lydia on her marriage, explained to her that, by his wife at least,
if not by himself, such a hope was cherished.	131.3119
But, Lizzy, you
look as if you did not enjoy it.	45.1415
From this day you must
be a stranger to one of your parents.--Your mother will never see you
again if you do _not_ marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again
if you _do_."	65.8133
It was owing to him, to his
     reserve, and want of proper consideration, that Wickham's character
     had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he had been
     received and noticed as he was.	70.5477
My courage always rises with every attempt to
intimidate me."	72.5390
She is all affability and condescension, and I
doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when
service is over.	116.5481
You must send John with
the young ladies, Mrs. Collins.	79.3382
Very well.	20.3837
Are you out of your senses, to be
accepting this man?	118.2307
There's for you!	60.9000
Seriously, however, she felt tolerably
persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman's
concurrence.	86.7090
I need not explain myself farther; and
     though _we_ know this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she
     feels it, it will easily account for her behaviour to me; and so
     deservedly dear as he is to his sister, whatever anxiety she may
     feel on his behalf, is natural and amiable.	165.0550
My dear Mr. Bennet," cried his wife, "what are you
talking of?	45.7823
It should not be said, that the Miss Bennets could not be at
home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers.	58.4705
"Indeed, you are mistaken, Madam.	29.1717
She could not determine how her mother
would take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur
would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man.	272.2372
In the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty, who had been
too busily engaged in their separate apartments, to make their
appearance before.	320.6412
Had Elizabeth's opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could
not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic
comfort.	160.1006
or under what misrepresentation, can you here impose upon others?"	175.8334
Kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped
her turn was coming soon.	127.5402
Mrs.
Reynolds could interest her on no other point.	101.0095
The morrow produced no abatement of Mrs. Bennet's ill humour or ill
health.	210.5839
The particulars, I reserve till we meet.	115.3789
It was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from Jane.	35.7768
Why does she not come in?"	114.7918
"I am astonished," said Miss Bingley, "that my father should have left
so small a collection of books.--What a delightful library you have at
Pemberley, Mr.	83.6162
In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother's
words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible
whisper; for to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that the
chief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them.	136.4222
I am glad of one thing, that he
comes alone; because we shall see the less of him.	70.5362
I felt a
little uneasy--a little fearful of my sister's happiness with him in
marriage, because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite
right.	69.8268
Do you not consider that a connection with you,
must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?"	76.5732
There was a
something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive
and anxious attention, while she added,

"When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean that
either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement, but that from
knowing him better, his disposition was better understood."	150.3281
Mrs. Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen enough of
Bingley's behaviour to Jane, to be convinced that she would get him at
last; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happy
humour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at
not seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals.	78.4015
"Not that I _shall_ though," she added to herself, as she finished the
letter; "and my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in an honourable
manner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it
out."	67.0068
Of the lady's sensations they remained a little in
doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was
evident enough.	132.5875
But with such
a father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is no
chance of it."	63.8757
You both did as much as you could, in planning the
marriage.	84.5614
"If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it."	45.0587
You may imagine what I felt
     and how I acted.	52.3745
The former was divided between
admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion,
and doubt as to the occasion's justifying her coming so far alone.	173.2419
"I do not recollect that we did."	28.9866
"You judge very properly," said Mr. Bennet, "and it is happy for you
that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy.	170.5341
Mr.	9.4864
"At four o'clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making gentleman,"
said Mr. Bennet, as he folded up the letter.	71.8581
We must not be so ready to fancy
ourselves intentionally injured.	6213.1716
Mr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was
turned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated
himself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into
conversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, and on the
probability of a rainy season, made her feel that the commonest,
dullest, most thread-bare topic might be rendered interesting by the
skill of the speaker.	192.1174
You will hardly blame me for refusing to
     comply with this entreaty, or for resisting every repetition of it.	98.9876
It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we
cannot escape the acquaintance now."	56.1733
"Oh!	6.3514
"My beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners--my behaviour
to _you_ was at least always bordering on the uncivil, and I never spoke
to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not.	251.1617
"Go, my dear," cried her mother, "and shew her ladyship about the
different walks.	116.4038
Bingley
was ready, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased.	92.1309
She liked
him too little to care for his approbation.	49.5721
But I knew I should
persuade you at last.	37.4692
Mr. Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation, that he
never again distressed himself, or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth,
by introducing the subject of it; and she was pleased to find that she
had said enough to keep him quiet.	144.9756
Such a charming man!--so handsome!	64.0113
We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but
this would be nothing if you really liked him."	125.9815

This, she would not hear of; but she was not so
unwilling to comply with their brother's proposal; and it was settled
that Mr. Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet
were not decidedly better.	74.6353
But Jane and Elizabeth, who
agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister's feelings and
consequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents,
urged him so earnestly, yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her
and her husband at Longbourn, as soon as they were married, that he was
prevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished.	78.4843
We will settle with your father about the money
afterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately."	183.8782
All Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man, who, but three months
before, had been almost an angel of light.	78.9006
"About a month ago I received this letter, and about a fortnight ago I
answered it, for I thought it a case of some delicacy, and requiring
early attention.	185.1979
She assured him that no one intended to play, and the
silence of the whole party on the subject, seemed to justify her.	40.3372
More thoughtfulness, and less anxiety to please
than when they last met, were plainly expressed.	608.1798
You refuse, then, to oblige me.	39.7313
No, never.	105.5441
A carat character is used to denote superscription.	99.7363
Lydia laughed, and said,

"Aye, that is just like your formality and discretion.	213.1236
Elizabeth saw directly that her
father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were
at the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often
disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.	157.9854
"Your
cousin's conduct does not suit my feelings.	67.4296
He danced only
four dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain knowledge,
more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner.	190.6960
Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from
Charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling.	97.9543
Had his character been known, this could not
have happened.	60.6523
It will then be publicly
seen, that on both sides, we meet only as common and indifferent
acquaintance."	217.1443
If
that had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon."	52.3659
I do not know whether I ever before
mentioned to you my feelings on this subject, but I will not leave the
country without confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them
unreasonable.	150.6202
The
gentlemen did approach; and when Mr. Wickham walked into the room,
Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking
of him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration.	112.2825
"And my aunt Philips is sure it would do _me_ a great deal of good,"
added Kitty.	50.5540
"I deserve neither such praise nor such censure," cried Elizabeth; "I am
_not_ a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things."	110.5031
But afterwards she
seemed to improve on you, and I believe you thought her rather pretty at
one time."	97.3532
She answered with equal
indifference and brevity, and the other said no more.	81.7039
Mr. Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday, his wife received a
letter from him; it told them, that on his arrival, he had immediately
found out his brother, and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch street.	71.4927
"You used us abominably ill," answered Mrs. Hurst, "in running away
without telling us that you were coming out."	209.0943
After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity, Mr.
Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of
Saturday.	133.4681
And with these words he hastily left the room, and Elizabeth heard him
the next moment open the front door and quit the house.	139.2128
Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach
of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look, which shewed her
better satisfied with their visitors, than Elizabeth.	121.3296
"Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible."	47.4752
"You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion, after
seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting
yesterday.--Are you much acquainted with Mr.	145.9932
Catherine and Lydia had
information for them of a different sort.	76.4099
She stared, coloured,
doubted, and was silent.	70.8094
Her father lifted up his eyes.	30.6098
My
youngest sister has left all her friends--has eloped;--has thrown
herself into the power of--of Mr. Wickham.	116.9799
Without a governess you must
have been neglected."	51.2283
But the horror of what might possibly happen,
almost took from me my faculties."	166.3245
Mrs. Bennet was quite in the fidgets.	17.5550
If he could any how
discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare, he
determined to make enquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible
to find out the stand and number of the coach.	251.6523
And if you will stay
another _month_ complete, it will be in my power to take one of you as
far as London, for I am going there early in June, for a week; and as
Dawson does not object to the Barouche box, there will be very good room
for one of you--and indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, I
should not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you large."	111.9967
Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only
wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern
in parting with her, that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer
of the chaise into an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the
present.	145.3119
Then pray speak aloud.	144.6712
He should be particularly happy at any time, &c. &c.; and if she would
give him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on them.	69.8513
But as no such delicacy restrained her mother, an
hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley, express her
impatience for his arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he
did not come back, she should think herself very ill used.	169.3500
Mrs. Hurst
thought the same, and added,

"She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent
walker.	67.5863
Your sister I also watched.--Her look and
     manners were open, cheerful and engaging as ever, but without any
     symptom of peculiar regard, and I remained convinced from the
     evening's scrutiny, that though she received his attentions with
     pleasure, she did not invite them by any participation of
     sentiment.--If _you_ have not been mistaken here, _I_ must have
     been in an error.	122.9587
"My dear, dear Lizzy, I would--I do congratulate you--but are you
certain?	63.7967
"My dear, dear Lydia!"	21.2517
Oh!	6.3514
"My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them--by which
means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents."	345.7296
Had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement
took place?	141.8854
I pity you, Miss Eliza, for this discovery of your favourite's guilt;
but really considering his descent, one could not expect much better."	146.9455
She was afraid of talking longer of his
friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the
trouble of finding a subject to him.	47.0637
Such amiable qualities must speak for
themselves.	264.0147
Poor Charlotte!--it was melancholy to leave her to
such society!--But she had chosen it with her eyes open; and though
evidently regretting that her visitors were to go, she did not seem to
ask for compassion.	212.0214
She highly approved his forbearance, and they had leisure for a full
discussion of it, and for all the commendation which they civilly
bestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer walked back with
them to Longbourn, and during the walk, he particularly attended to her.	160.1900
She was _now_
struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and
wondered it had escaped her before.	77.9096

"And do you like her?"	23.3769
How are they even to be discovered?	71.8915
He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity.	307.8718
"You doubt me," cried Jane, slightly colouring; "indeed you have no
reason.	123.1769
"If you _will_ thank me," he replied, "let it be for yourself alone.	53.9504
Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment.	41.6172
Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne
without anger such treatment; but Sir William's good breeding carried
him through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the
truth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the
most forbearing courtesy.	352.0226
You must not disappoint your father."	41.0710
Lydia, my love, though you _are_
the youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next
ball."	42.2822
The Gardiners staid only one night at Longbourn, and set off the next
morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement.	118.1315
"Nearly three weeks."	47.9848

Catherine, weak-spirited,
irritable, and completely under Lydia's guidance, had been always
affronted by their advice; and Lydia, self-willed and careless, would
scarcely give them a hearing.	552.2239
It is Mr. Bingley
I am sure.	14.2529
She will
make him a very proper wife."	50.0471
He had rather hoped that all his wife's
views on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found that he
had a very different story to hear.	67.8532
Mr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by admiring Mrs.
Philips's manners and politeness.	358.9332
He then shut the door, and coming up to her, claimed the good wishes and
affection of a sister.	200.2179
"Yes, she called yesterday with her father.	44.5214
so tall!--Oh, my
dear Lizzy!	61.8029
My dear Charles, what do you mean?"	30.5277
my dear father," she cried, "come back, and write immediately.	45.5323
With _them_ he is remarkably
agreeable."	103.1967

But make a virtue of it
by all means.	90.0362
She had even condescended to advise him to
marry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had
once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage; where she had perfectly
approved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed
to suggest some herself,--some shelves in the closets up stairs.	159.6526
The tête-à-tête surprised
them.	62.7789

cried Mrs. Bennet, shaking her head, "then she is better off than
many girls.	107.8566
He seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised for his
intrusion, by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to
be within.	111.1485
I know no harm of her."	14.7756
"What sort of a girl is Miss Darcy?"	58.7844
It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession
of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.	68.9692
She dreaded seeing Wickham again,
and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible.	63.5469

But, Lizzy, this must go no farther
     than yourself, or Jane at most.	101.2088
"Oh!	6.3514
I declare I do not
know a more aweful object than Darcy, on particular occasions, and in
particular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening
when he has nothing to do."	133.2905
I will answer for it he never cared
three straws about her.	111.1509
Every thing
that is charming!	40.1614
But are you pleased,
Jane?	52.7911
Miss Bingley was
then sorry that she had proposed the delay, for her jealousy and dislike
of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other.	293.2621
They are gone down to
Newcastle, a place quite northward, it seems, and there they are to
stay, I do not know how long.	85.9372
"Did not you?	32.7165
Mrs.
Bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter,
and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the
opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible; advice, which there
was every reason to believe would be attended to; and in the clamorous
happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more gentle adieus
of her sisters were uttered without being heard.	144.5690
"Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of," cried Colonel
Fitzwilliam.	68.7716
"That is capital," added her sister, and they both laughed heartily.	197.3284
Elizabeth was delighted.	15.6047
You shall hear what she says."	29.8355
The
hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture were examined and praised;
and his commendation of every thing would have touched Mrs. Bennet's
heart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his
own future property.	166.7342
The hill, crowned with wood, from
which they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the
distance, was a beautiful object.	348.3943
I ought not to have said a word about it.	25.6230
In consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth wrote the
next morning to her mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for
them in the course of the day.	62.6220

she repeated.	66.0434
Any other inconsistencies with modern spellings have

I should have considered it as part of my duty, and
the exertion would soon have been nothing.	64.2222
Why, especially, when you called, did
you look as if you did not care about me?"	65.1268
"A thorough, determined dislike of me--a dislike which I cannot but
attribute in some measure to jealousy.	432.8136
I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment."	26.4437
"Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?"	154.6395
On finding
Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon
after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words,

"May I hope, Madam, for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth,
when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the
course of this morning?"	87.5866
I can remember no symptom of affection on either
side; and had any thing of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware
that ours is not a family, on which it could be thrown away.	98.9484
Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

Besides, there was truth in his
looks."	112.3383
His affection for
her soon sunk into indifference; her's lasted a little longer; and in
spite of her youth and her manners, she retained all the claims to
reputation which her marriage had given her.	284.7459
Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit
down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr. Darcy had been
standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and
Mr. Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his
friend to join it.	75.0848
He did not
repeat his persuasion of their not marrying--and from _that_, I am
inclined to hope, he might have been misunderstood before."	85.4468
Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at
least not to Elizabeth's wishes, for she was impatient to get home.	46.3088
How thankful am I,
     that we never let them know what has been said against him; we must
     forget it ourselves.	216.2168
"It was a subject which they could not mention before me."	35.1645
His belief of her sister's
insensibility, she instantly resolved to be false, and his account of
the real, the worst objections to the match, made her too angry to have
any wish of doing him justice.	84.4124
Elizabeth was not surprised at it, as
Jane had written the direction remarkably ill.	95.7220
He was as generous, she
doubted not, as the most generous of his sex.	83.3094
The others have been gone on to Scarborough,
these three weeks."	70.5164
"My uncle is to send a servant for us."	36.9887
"Pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs,
between the mercenary and the prudent motive?	147.6048
"I honour your circumspection.	287.4437
At such a moment, the arrival of her friend
was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in the course of their
meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she
saw Mr. Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her
husband.	188.0792
Where there is fortune to make the expence of
travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil.	295.5989
What is your own opinion?"	25.4558
They were of a respectable family in
the north of England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their
memories than that their brother's fortune and their own had been
acquired by trade.	143.5395
"Upon my word," said Mrs. Gardiner, "I begin to be of your uncle's
opinion.	29.4216
He said as little as he had ever been in the
habit of saying; made no mention of the business that had taken him
away, and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of
it.	51.6775
It will be in my power to
assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se'night."	62.1546
And
though he exclaimed at the term, she found that it had been pretty much
the case.	51.0479
His regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her
deserving her mother's reproach prevented his feeling any regret.	328.3414
It was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that
they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a
return.	118.3110
"I have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this year
or two.	83.1529
From Elizabeth's thoughts it was never absent.	76.1857
"I do not pretend to
regret any thing I shall leave in Hertfordshire, except your society, my
dearest friend; but we will hope at some future period, to enjoy many
returns of the delightful intercourse we have known, and in the mean
while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most
unreserved correspondence.	247.5978
At present I will
say nothing about it."	35.2363
I was afraid they might
not; and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle, so I was
determined he should know it, and so I let down the side glass next to
him, and took off my glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window
frame, so that he might see the ring, and then I bowed and smiled like
any thing."	363.1841
Mr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he
received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia.	113.2481
To work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures; and
Elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which Charlotte talked
of the healthfulness of the exercise, and owned she encouraged it as
much as possible.	146.9275
He was always to have gone on
Saturday, and to Saturday he still meant to stay.	74.8987
"Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not treat
the matter as you do now."	54.2616
On being made acquainted with the
present Mr. Darcy's treatment of him, she tried to remember something of
that gentleman's reputed disposition when quite a lad, which might agree
with it, and was confident at last, that she recollected having heard
Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud, ill-natured
boy.	188.1254
I should never be happy without
     him, so think it no harm to be off.	82.5998
From the farther disadvantage of Lydia's
society she was of course carefully kept, and though Mrs. Wickham
frequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the promise of
balls and young men, her father would never consent to her going.	243.0189
I was ready to die of laughter.	166.7843
However, I did not hear above one word in ten,
for I was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham.	109.0085
Its windows
opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody
hills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chesnuts
which were scattered over the intermediate lawn.	608.8785
Her father had most cruelly mortified her, by
what he said of Mr. Darcy's indifference, and she could do nothing but
wonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that perhaps, instead of
his seeing too _little_, she might have fancied too _much_.	86.1213
Without supposing
them, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference
of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and she
resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left
Hertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such
an attachment.	125.9237
When the tea-things were removed, and the card tables placed, the ladies
all rose, and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him, when
all her views were overthrown, by seeing him fall a victim to her
mother's rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seated
with the rest of the party.	182.3750
Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of
his behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave them to understand, in as
guarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from his
relations in Kent, his actions were capable of a very different
construction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor
Wickham's so amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire.	107.3731
The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.	90.3478
"Are you so severe upon your own sex, as to doubt the possibility of all
this?"	63.8837
Bingley was by no means deficient,
but Darcy was clever.	102.2070
Ten
thousand a year, and very likely more!	76.2374
It was consequently necessary to
name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity; to have
some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by
again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the
present, and prepare for another disappointment.	369.1224
His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost.	152.0045
said Elizabeth.	12.2461
But when you have had time to think it all over, I hope you
will be satisfied with what I have done.	46.2294
One ought not to
repine;--but, to be sure, it would have been such a thing for me!	48.0808
Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.	2520.2751
Perhaps _she_ is full young to be much
in company.	96.9580
Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr. Bingley's
name was scarcely ever mentioned between them.	85.1192
They were ignorant, idle, and vain.	77.6036
"Yours, &c."

"Well, my dear," said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the note
aloud, "if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness, if she
should die, it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of
Mr. Bingley, and under your orders."	103.3789
Mr. Collins returned most punctually on the Monday fortnight, but his
reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his
first introduction.	147.2052
We are not rich enough, or grand enough for them; and she is the
more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion that
when there has been _one_ intermarriage, she may have less trouble in
achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and I
dare say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way.	93.0126
She grew absolutely ashamed of herself.--Of neither Darcy nor Wickham
could she think, without feeling that she had been blind, partial,
prejudiced, absurd.	168.2235
But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation,
she made no answer.	53.3901
Lady Lucas quieted her fears a
little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get a
large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr. Bingley
was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly.	182.1545
But now she would no longer
conceal from her, his share in Lydia's marriage.	71.9407
Mr. Gardiner was a sensible, gentleman-like man, greatly
superior to his sister, as well by nature as education.	134.1654
At
that moment Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass
through the set to the other side of the room; but on perceiving Mr.
Darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his
dancing and his partner.	150.8652
To persuade him against
     returning into Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been given,
     was scarcely the work of a moment.--I cannot blame myself for
     having done thus much.	108.6050
You have a sweet room here, Mr. Bingley, and a charming prospect
over that gravel walk.	136.9735
She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others; there was a
solidity in his reflections which often struck her, and though by no
means so clever as herself, she thought that if encouraged to read and
improve himself by such an example as her's, he might become a very
agreeable companion.	250.8839
No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can
think any thing wanting.	143.7331
A small part of Derbyshire is all the present
concern.	69.9201
said Elizabeth, "but the terms, I suppose, must be
complied with."	42.6463
It was over at last however.	37.8752
In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane to make
her resigned.	144.3921
They all paint tables, cover skreens and net
purses.	394.4897
Her colour
changed, and she said no more.	81.7470
I cannot misunderstand you, but I intreat
you, dear Lizzy, not to pain me by thinking _that person_ to blame, and
saying your opinion of him is sunk.	151.6164
First of all, he asked Miss Lucas.	71.7812
"What would she have said?--how
would she have behaved?"	154.4424
Her air
was not conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them, such as to
make her visitors forget their inferior rank.	132.0621
Five daughters
successively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs.
Bennet, for many years after Lydia's birth, had been certain that he
would.	91.8255
I mend
pens remarkably well."	107.0816
Jane was distressed.	20.4188
"_You_ go to Brighton!--I would not trust you so near it as East Bourne
for fifty pounds!	125.6265
"I am sure I shall break _mine_," said Lydia.	38.6789
Oh!	6.3514
Not like the wild young men now-a-days, who think of nothing but
themselves.	163.6058
I know my own strength, and I shall never be embarrassed again by
his coming.	64.2865
"Not at all.	20.0380
But the case is
this.	36.9749
Her astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed, was
increased by every review of it.	139.9143
"It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean he _should_."	43.7667
I saw them the night before last."	56.3214
Is this your gratitude
for my attentions to you last spring?	144.2470
There--I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it;
and really, all things considered, I begin to think it perfectly
reasonable.	140.6554
He was very fond of them."	12.1554
Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she left Elizabeth to walk
by herself.	285.3978
If this be the case, he deserves you.	63.8503
The
quiet, the retirement of such a life, would have answered all my ideas
of happiness!	82.4090
Good bye.	80.6593
Her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied
with believing that _she_ would have been his only choice, had fortune
permitted it.	290.0113
Elizabeth, for the sake of
saying something that might turn her mother's thoughts, now asked her if
Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since _her_ coming away.	79.9986

Words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he was
obliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth tried to unite civility
and truth in a few short sentences.	138.1007
Eager to be alone, and fearful of enquiries or hints from her
uncle and aunt, she staid with them only long enough to hear their
favourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.	115.2550
Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning;
but Mrs. Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the
affair as she wished, was excessively disappointed.	149.2598
Her aunt now called her to look at a picture.	72.2232
With a glance she saw,
that he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his
politeness, she began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place;
but she had not got beyond the words "delightful," and "charming," when
some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of
Pemberley from her, might be mischievously construed.	175.2490
It is, in short, impossible for us to
conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them,
without actual blame on either side."	108.4726
Will you be very angry with me, my dear
     Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying (what I was never bold
     enough to say before) how much I like him.	50.5880
Let me know every thing that I am to know, without delay.	57.7129
"My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts.	74.2375
Are you lost to every feeling of
propriety and delicacy?	237.3568
Her face is too thin; her complexion has no
brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome.	150.3573
Let us hope, therefore, that her being
there may teach her her own insignificance.	128.6091

This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted: and
Elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself,
soon went away.	146.8853
Miss Darcy, on her brother's
entrance, exerted herself much more to talk; and Elizabeth saw that he
was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded,
as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side.	90.1703
Elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went
to a window to enjoy its prospect.	89.7742
But, Lizzy!	19.8606
At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here."	61.5479
The
housekeeper at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the
arrival of her master, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot
there for several weeks.	106.2484
If he had been wavering before, as to what he should do, which had often
seemed likely, the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might
settle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy, as dignity
unblemished could make him.	132.1395
Had Miss Bingley known what
pain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have
refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose
Elizabeth, by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed
her partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in
Darcy's opinion, and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and
absurdities, by which some part of her family were connected with that
corps.	192.5486
But when they had withdrawn, he said to her, "Mrs.
Bennet, before you take any, or all of these houses, for your son and
daughter, let us come to a right understanding.	101.5432
"You did!	31.5251
"What could become of Mr. Bingley and Jane!"	28.0814
No, no,
you shall not deceive me.	33.2395
Not that _I_ think
Charlotte so _very_ plain--but then she is our particular friend."	135.2462
Whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done
gracefully.	135.2736
why is not every body as happy?"	69.1485
"To Jane herself," she exclaimed, "there could be no possibility of
objection.	108.3475
They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr. Gardiner, after
general assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told
her that he meant to be in London the very next day, and would assist
Mr. Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia.	112.1811
To the rest of the family they paid little attention;
avoiding Mrs. Bennet as much as possible, saying not much to Elizabeth,
and nothing at all to the others.	99.1763
Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you
pleasure."	241.7690
Unfortunately an only son, (for many years an only _child_)
I was spoilt by my parents, who though good themselves, (my father
particularly, all that was benevolent and amiable,) allowed, encouraged,
almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing, to care for none beyond
my own family circle, to think meanly of all the rest of the world, to
_wish_ at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with
my own.	273.6957
Lakes, mountains,
and rivers, shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations; nor, when
we attempt to describe any particular scene, will we begin quarrelling
about its relative situation.	688.4455
At Brighton she will be of less importance
even as a common flirt than she has been here.	194.6903
Elizabeth again, and more
seriously assured her of its truth.	105.3838
"So much the better.	24.0913
And
gathering her work together, she was hastening away, when Elizabeth
called out,

"Dear Ma'am, do not go.--I beg you will not go.--Mr.	83.9103
In a doleful voice Mrs. Bennet thus began the projected
conversation.--"Oh!	140.9031
Elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of
his situation, now forced herself to speak; and immediately, though not
very fluently, gave him to understand, that her sentiments had undergone
so material a change, since the period to which he alluded, as to make
her receive with gratitude and pleasure, his present assurances.	171.2876

"I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us.	40.8901
"Wickham, perhaps,
is my favourite; but I think I shall like _your_ husband quite as well
as Jane's."	71.0268
Mrs. Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs. Philips, and
_she_ ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all her
neighbours in Meryton.	63.9967
How Mr. Darcy looked, therefore, she could
not tell.	23.9724
She answered him with cold civility.	44.2042
She
is gone down to her uncle at Liverpool; gone to stay.	70.9797
This information, however, startled Mrs. Bennet;--she would have been
glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage
him by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not to believe
it, and could not help saying so.	102.5258
"I have every reason in the world to think ill of you.	38.9162
To interrupt
a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed,
she soon afterwards said,

"I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of
having somebody at his disposal.	166.9937
I am sure you must feel it
so."	20.1394
Had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and
such realities as these, what would have been her sensations?	477.5188
Can there be any other opinion on the subject?"	94.5528
"Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished.	55.1892
She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she
made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the
neighbourhood, nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or
two, to visit his relations.	119.5024
But our visitor
     was very obstinate.	83.6545
The second began.	105.0814
He scarcely ever spoke to
her, and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of
himself, were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose
civility in listening to him, was a seasonable relief to them all, and
especially to her friend.	45.4538
Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her.	29.5843
As Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she
and her children should go to London, at the same time that Mr. Bennet
came from it.	36.2179
Jane was beyond competition her
favourite child.	113.4830
"If they had uncles enough to fill _all_ Cheapside," cried Bingley, "it
would not make them one jot less agreeable."	158.3284
The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent, had
made a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the
verdure of the early trees.	92.3616
CHAPTER XI.	6.6303
By many significant looks and silent
entreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of
complaisance,--but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an
opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song.	174.2544
"He made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit of his
modesty."	44.1459
He
is so excessively handsome!	39.5925
The bride and her mother could neither
of them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to sit near
Elizabeth, began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood,
with a good humoured ease, which she felt very unable to equal in her
replies.	169.2065
He was full of joy and
attention.	47.3083
when I went away, I am sure
I had no more idea of being married till I came back again!	35.7954
I do not wish to avoid the walk.	20.7141
Mr. Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great
politeness by the whole family.	41.0761
I am quite well.	13.0844
While settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the
door bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its
being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in
the evening, and might now come to enquire particularly after her.	105.1931
He still loves me, and we are
engaged."	59.0301
There was nothing of presumption
or folly in Bingley, that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him
into silence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric than the
other had ever seen him.	317.6964
"Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so," said Mr. Collins
very gravely--"but I cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all
disapprove of you.	75.1961
Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best
wishes for your health and happiness."	95.5169
You dare not,
you cannot deny that you have been the principal, if not the only means
of dividing them from each other, of exposing one to the censure of the
world for caprice and instability, the other to its derision for
disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest
kind."	130.6440
Allowing the case, however, to stand
according to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet, that
the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and the
delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering one
argument in favour of its propriety."	161.8130
If you love Mr. Darcy half as well as I do my dear
     Wickham, you must be very happy.	58.7214
Mrs. Gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were now
approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to
the charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out
to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs, to think of
any thing else.	134.0629
"Of music!	38.6844
From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day
     after ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting
     for them.	127.3987
Mary," said she, "I wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun!	41.1532
She enquired after his sister, but could do no more.	28.6089
Then, the two third he danced with Miss
King, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane
again, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the Boulanger----"

"If he had had any compassion for _me_," cried her husband impatiently,
"he would not have danced half so much!	114.4312
Elizabeth listened as little as she
could, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham's name.	55.2671
She opened the
door, and met Maria in the landing place, who, breathless with
agitation, cried out,

"Oh, my dear Eliza!	171.3591
What a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosing's Park, when
he put his letter into her hand!	199.7624
The family were assembled in the breakfast room, to receive
them.	36.6023
"Very true; and if I had my will, we should.	141.7569
From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr. Darcy
had been over-rated, Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs. Gardiner's
long letter, but now, having _that_ to communicate which she knew would
be most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find, that her uncle and aunt
had already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as
follows:

     "I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought to have
     done, for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of particulars; but
     to say the truth, I was too cross to write.	122.9772
Do
you often dance at St.	165.1113
"It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began.	71.7173
My daughter and my
nephew are formed for each other.	53.2037
The
rector of a parish has much to do.--In the first place, he must make
such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not
offensive to his patron.	151.1092
Elizabeth was surprised, but said
not a word.	32.0277
Poor
Jane!	27.7421
I am ashamed of you!	13.1619
It was
unpardonable.	27.7815
said Charlotte, as soon as he was
gone.	21.6593
I have a high respect for your nerves.	46.2719
Conceal the unhappy truth as
long as it is possible.--I know it cannot be long."	137.0080
But as it is--you
must not let your fancy run away with you.	62.5102
Lady Catherine seemed pleased.	20.5938
She will be taken good care of.	72.5386
After a song
or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she
would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her
sister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in
the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always
impatient for display.	226.4101
He looked serious as usual; and
she thought, more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, than as
she had seen him at Pemberley.	41.2350
They travelled as expeditiously as possible; and sleeping one night on
the road, reached Longbourn by dinner-time the next day.	296.8993
It was my brother Gardiner's drawing up too, and I wonder how he came to
make such an awkward business of it.	96.5198
"Has she been presented?	131.3078
Darcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same;
and Mrs. Hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and
rings, joined now and then in her brother's conversation with Miss
Bennet.	189.3516
"But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to conceal
it, he must find it out."	35.5051
Elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for Lady
Catherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying, and burying
his parishioners whenever it were required.	92.1445
This information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor Miss
Bingley.	68.0562
I am afraid you will not be able to make
     it out, but I hardly know what I have written."	19.4392
If you'll believe
me, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there a
fortnight.	116.3696
While she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to
rejoice over her words, or to distrust their meaning.	269.2955
Jane was anxious that no
difference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded
that she talked as much as ever.	97.8561
Pray do not talk of that odious man.	43.4314
CHAPTER II.	6.6303
it must be my uncle's doings!	239.4627
"Come, Darcy," said he, "I must have you dance.	60.8606
I now give it to _you_, if you are resolved on
having him.	36.7760
I do assure you, that the news does not
affect me either with pleasure or pain.	76.6322
To Elizabeth it appeared, that had her family made an agreement to
expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would
have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit, or
finer success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister
that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his
feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he
must have witnessed.	183.4382
Darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say
something indistinctly of his concern, and observe her in compassionate
silence.	249.0819
"Only this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will
make an offer to me."	53.5849
"In my opinion, the younger son of an Earl can know very little of
either.	107.2539
Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth could not
return it.	31.1754
There is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his
letter, which promises well.	72.5503
"I am glad I bought my
bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox!	82.2275
no, no, this is not likely.	46.6793
"I do assure you, Sir, that I have no pretension whatever to that kind
of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man.	149.4729
By supposing such an
affection, you make every body acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most
unhappy.	154.5297
dear Lizzy, only
consider what he must have suffered.	44.0011
"How so?	33.5844
cried Elizabeth.	13.9626
But do you
always write such charming long letters to her, Mr.	115.8970
The far and the near must be relative, and depend on many
varying circumstances.	256.8805
Elizabeth blushed
and blushed again with shame and vexation.	68.9244
I hope you have destroyed the letter.	49.4260
She answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resist
the temptation, added, "When you met us there the other day, we had just
been forming a new acquaintance."	91.0802
A younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and
dependence."	89.3503
My excellent father
     died about five years ago; and his attachment to Mr. Wickham was to
     the last so steady, that in his will he particularly recommended it
     to me, to promote his advancement in the best manner that his
     profession might allow, and if he took orders, desired that a
     valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became
     vacant.	193.5147
_She_ will not be able to help calling."	23.9092
"I know you do; and it is _that_ which makes the wonder.	62.1561
I have nothing to say against
_him_; he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he
ought to have, I should think you could not do better.	57.8746
Five daughters brought up at home
without a governess!--I never heard of such a thing.	114.6310
I never met with anybody who delighted me
so much.	93.8283
At length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of
Elizabeth after the health of her family.	80.9653
It is admirable!"	73.4715
She had never heard of him before his
entrance into the ----shire Militia, in which he had engaged at the
persuasion of the young man, who, on meeting him accidentally in town,
had there renewed a slight acquaintance.	124.7699
Bingley met them with hopes
that Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected.	107.6422
Never, since reading Jane's second letter, had she entertained
a hope of Wickham's meaning to marry her.	109.5877
Had they been
only ten minutes sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his
discrimination, for it was plain that he was that moment arrived, that
moment alighted from his horse or his carriage.	99.9526
The
liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value!"	239.5019
Before Elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise, Mrs.
Bennet instantly answered,

"Oh dear!--Yes--certainly.--I am sure Lizzy will be very happy--I am
sure she can have no objection.--Come, Kitty, I want you up stairs."	140.9714
Mr. Wickham's attention was caught; and after observing Mr. Collins for
a few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation
were very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh.	83.1951
I have not _that_ pain.	37.2134
He dined with us the next day, and was to leave town again
     on Wednesday or Thursday.	83.2600
There is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of
character and ideas between us.	140.7205
"Can you deny that you have done it?"	45.8878
With a
book he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a
good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised
such splendid expectations.	223.1485
Elizabeth quietly answered "Undoubtedly;"--and after an awkward pause,
they returned to the rest of the family.	81.8355
"Who do you mean, my dear?	30.4988
"His misfortunes!"	37.6593
Mrs. Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment
of her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a family
dinner.	99.5240
But that is not the
case _here_.	41.9885
May I ask
whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the
moment, or are the result of previous study?"	338.6328
They are
wanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are not they?"	60.7311
She remembered also, that till the Netherfield
family had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but
herself; but that after their removal, it had been every where
discussed; that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr.
Darcy's character, though he had assured her that respect for the
father, would always prevent his exposing the son.	181.7394
Well, any friend of
Mr. Bingley's will always be welcome here to be sure; but else I must
say that I hate the very sight of him."	115.9022
You do not look
well.	24.2566
Elizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on seeing
the Lakes; and still thought there might have been time enough.	121.0311
And then, you know, when once they get
together, there is no end of it.	49.2861
I hope your plans in favour of the ----shire will
not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood."	101.4583
After this day, Jane said no more of her indifference.	41.2447
"You are then resolved to have him?"	28.4285
Elizabeth merely
curtseyed to him, without saying a word.	41.5192
"What do you mean?"	22.2254
"You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure,--therefore you need not
conceal your age."	34.4464
He was silent.	10.8152
"I found," said he, "as the time drew near, that I had better not meet
Mr. Darcy;--that to be in the same room, the same party with him for so
many hours together, might be more than I could bear, and that scenes
might arise unpleasant to more than myself."	104.0331
The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would
return Mr. Bennet's visit, and determining when they should ask him to
dinner.	60.4278
When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were
mentioned, in terms of such mortifying, yet merited reproach, her sense
of shame was severe.	121.6522
"Indeed I could not.	46.4114
It was a large, well-proportioned
room, handsomely fitted up.	73.7431
My sole dependence was on you; and
I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not.	130.3627
From such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink.	46.8766
Her mother
impatiently met her at the door of the dressing-room, to ask why Lady
Catherine would not come in again and rest herself.	173.8252
"Can I have the carriage?"	45.0754
But
my dearest love, tell me what dish Mr. Darcy is particularly fond of,
that I may have it to-morrow."	77.1996
When Denny,
and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or three more of the men came in, they
did not know him in the least.	66.0160
Mrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred, during
their visit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested
them both.	80.2834
But however insincere _you_ may
choose to be, you shall not find _me_ so.	124.7618
Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied,

"The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind.	88.1266
Now, Lizzy, I think I _have_
surprised you.	36.4625
Good bye."	80.6593
