60.482822350895795
said she.	10.9452
But it ought to
be done, and if you will give me a sheet of paper, it shall be done
directly."	25.3437
The whole party before
them, indeed, excited a lively attention.	36.2783
You must come and make Lizzy marry Mr. Collins, for she vows she will
not have him, and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and
not have _her_."	58.2066
Your idea of the ponies is delightful.	47.2289
But I can assure the young ladies that I come
prepared to admire them.	37.9668
"Well, and what news does it bring?	50.0925
For herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him.	47.5579
"I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself.	17.4923
Elizabeth's eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations; and she
watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience
which was very ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving
amongst the thanks of the table, the hint of a hope that she might be
prevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of half a minute
began another.	74.0850
You must feel it; and the usual
satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because
you have always so much."	55.4855
Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was.	64.7354
I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes.	77.7437
It was a handsome modern building, well
situated on rising ground.	69.2006
It seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence,
a most country town indifference to decorum."	63.4770
"I have already told her so once, by your desire."	41.0091
"Did you speak from your own observation," said she, "when you told him
that my sister loved him, or merely from my information last spring?"	57.1999
"I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing.	49.5234
"And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, Ma'am?"	30.1423
"Never, sir."	59.0576
said she.	10.9452
When coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having
promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument.	47.9865
Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched on any man, within
the circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie more
effectually to what they related?	92.0119
"I do not at all know; but I _heard_ nothing of his going away when I
was at Netherfield.	37.7048
I would advise you merely to put on
whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest, there is no occasion
for any thing more.	54.3859
His daughter's request, for such it might be considered, of being
admitted into her family again, before she set off for the North,
received at first an absolute negative.	65.1188
You have liked many a
stupider person."	53.8355
The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to
Mr. Wickham's charge, exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could
bring no proof of its injustice.	92.7127
The room in which the ladies sat was backwards.	76.7870
We live in so different a part of
town, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go
out so little, that it is very improbable they should meet at all,
unless he really comes to see her."	55.3159
"Indeed!"	12.8546
It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you
must confess.	74.4136
And taking her hand, he would have given it to Mr. Darcy, who, though
extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly
drew back, and said with some discomposure to Sir William,

"Indeed, Sir, I have not the least intention of dancing.--I entreat you
not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner."	47.2433
Mrs. Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise
concerning that gentleman, and required information; and Elizabeth had
such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to
herself.	90.3399
She was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and
cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, had
not Jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her to wait, till her
father was at leisure to be consulted.	53.2307
And I think you will agree with me,
     in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable, both
     on his account and my niece's.	62.9391
"He is also handsome," replied Elizabeth, "which a young man ought
likewise to be, if he possibly can.	33.8580
Her curiosity however was unexpectedly
relieved.	60.2189
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.	84.2117
CHAPTER V.


"I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth," said her uncle, as they
drove from the town; "and really, upon serious consideration, I am much
more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does of the
matter.	51.2751
"That is very true," said Elizabeth; "though it had not occurred to me
before.	33.5337
When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley
began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room.	29.5961
"No," replied Jane, "I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing
satisfactory to tell you.	21.8314
Mr. Darcy was
     punctual in his return, and as Lydia informed you, attended the
     wedding.	41.1536
"_That_ is his notion of christian
forgiveness!	107.4944
These
were the contents:

     "MY DEAR HARRIET,

     "You will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I cannot help
     laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as I am
     missed.	56.5876
I do not know the
particulars, but I know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to
blame, that he cannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned, and that
though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his
invitation to the officers, he was excessively glad to find that he had
taken himself out of the way.	38.7453
My youngest of all, is lately married,
and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds, walking with a young man,
who I believe will soon become a part of the family."	66.3826
Scarcely any thing was talked of the whole day or next morning, but
their visit to Rosings.	34.1681
And when you have given _your_ ball," she
added, "I shall insist on their giving one also.	47.4272
On this point she was
soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they
parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a recollection of
Jane, not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of saying more that
might lead to the mention of her, had he dared.	68.0798
But I am
afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means
intend; for he would certainly think the better of me, if under such a
circumstance I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as I
could."	54.5763
Bennet?"	60.5674
and she coloured at the
idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, "And pray, what is
the usual price of an Earl's younger son?	64.6602
They both set off, and the conjectures of the remaining three
continued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown
open, and their visitor entered.	54.4158
"I am all astonishment.	21.3746
His character was decided.	24.8990
He
had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his
wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was
paid, she had no knowledge of it.	42.5539
By Jane this attention was received with the greatest
pleasure; but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of
every body, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them;
though their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in
all probability from the influence of their brother's admiration.	77.6023
"I had much rather go in the coach."	47.2418
The rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mrs. Forster,
the delight of Mrs. Bennet, and the mortification of Kitty, are scarcely
to be described.	51.2311
My father and mother knew nothing of that, they only felt how
imprudent a match it must be.	97.9661
It would be dreadful!	20.2880
She is the sort of
woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference."	61.0861
Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received
many months ago from Mr. Wickham.	52.1464
Such very
superior dancing is not often seen.	134.1136
Mrs. Collins, did I tell you of Lady Metcalfe's
calling yesterday to thank me?	66.5381
Miss Bingley was
engrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr.
Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to
eat, drink, and play at cards, who when he found her prefer a plain dish
to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.	66.1622
He had never had the
slightest suspicion.	24.9150
She had also to anticipate how her visit would
pass, the quiet tenor of their usual employments, the vexatious
interruptions of Mr. Collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with
Rosings.	68.2829
"I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend
very little of his time there in future.	56.5987
You had better return to your partner and enjoy her
smiles, for you are wasting your time with me."	58.8971
She seldom listened to any
body for more than half a minute, and never attended to Mary at all.	47.3951
"My dear Jane!"	11.6828
She was confident of having performed her duty, and to fret over
unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her
disposition.	64.0548
"Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise."	35.4517
"It did.	31.1505
"A great many indeed," said her companion with a sigh.	67.3302
As for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than
the last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not
long enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion; and
she lay awake two whole hours, endeavouring to make them out.	83.0865
Miss Bennet's pleasing manners grew on the
good will of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was
found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to, a
wish of being better acquainted with _them_, was expressed towards the
two eldest.	50.7824
"Of what are you talking?"	65.1617
As she had heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely to be
Lady Catherine, and under that apprehension was putting away her
half-finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions,
when the door opened, and to her very great surprise, Mr. Darcy, and Mr.
Darcy only, entered the room.	50.1657
"What is there of good to be expected?"	37.0481
In such an exigence my uncle's advice and
     assistance would be every thing in the world; he will immediately
     comprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness."	55.2586
Why must their
marriage be private?	96.5674
The gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have
answered her hopes; but, alas!	49.7505
"Sometimes.	65.2520
Lydia came to
     us; and Wickham had constant admission to the house.	39.6452
Allow me, by the
way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and
kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the
advantages in my power to offer.	34.2315
I only fear that
the sort of cautiousness, to which you, I imagine, have been alluding,
is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion and
judgment he stands much in awe.	85.2952
A regard for the requester would often make
one readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason
one into it.	135.2451
I knew it to be a
most respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend Denny tempted me
farther by his account of their present quarters, and the very great
attentions and excellent acquaintance Meryton had procured them.	71.5687
"Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to arrange
with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to
appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting
between the parties?"	79.6606
I have by no means done.	30.7880
"An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth.	83.6942
It cannot be concealed from any one.	15.7401
They
followed her into the dining-parlour.	23.3331
Women fancy admiration means more than
it does."	307.5366
How he lived I know not.	32.6632
"Yes, very handsome."	21.1665
I shall never forget her appearance this morning.	32.5847
"Where is your sister?"	46.8041
She had scarcely needed her
present observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that
their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love, rather
than by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring
for her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain
that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and
if that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity
of having a companion.	66.3605
"I understood that there were some very strong objections against the
lady."	59.5455
The suspicions which had just
arisen of Mr. Darcy and their niece, directed their observation towards
each with an earnest, though guarded, enquiry; and they soon drew from
those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what
it was to love.	69.3850
"But so we all do.	62.6398
There are few people in England, I suppose, who have more true enjoyment
of music than myself, or a better natural taste.	64.0580
"Now I am quite happy," said she, "for you will be as happy as myself.	21.7605
The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on a
headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that, added to
her unwillingness to see Mr. Darcy, it determined her not to attend her
cousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea.	77.9345
Mr. Darcy danced
only once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being
introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in
walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.	45.3328
"It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion,
to be secure of judging properly at first."	75.2959
on this
subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left
Hunsford--between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson was
arranging Miss de Bourgh's foot-stool, that she said, 'Mr.	73.7957
Lydia's going to Brighton was all that consoled her for the
melancholy conviction of her husband's never intending to go there
himself.	68.9153
single, my dear, to be sure!	41.1745
said her aunt.	17.2316
I am perfectly serious in my refusal.--You could not make _me_
happy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who
would make _you_ so.--Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I
am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the
situation."	43.4444
His attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect; but she
could not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal, or
feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again.	94.2935
"No.	32.1469
All loveliness and goodness as she is!	88.8468
I am so
grieved for him.	14.3898
cried his wife impatiently.	48.5140
By the Author of "Sense and Sensibility."	21.9071
"Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside."	82.8686
She
had never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural
beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste.	57.9960
As to what
restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a
dishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I know
nothing of the effects that such a step might produce.	62.4040
Compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_ never.	201.5353
"When is your next ball to be, Lizzy?"	61.3252
Her hair so untidy, so blowsy!"	134.3771
_That_ is all to be forgot.	35.0154
Had the late Mr. Darcy liked me
less, his son might have borne with me better; but his father's uncommon
attachment to me, irritated him I believe very early in life.	67.3973
_We_ were always good friends;
and now we are better."	57.1617
"What a letter is this, to be written at such a moment.	42.8813
The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week;
and, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being only one card
table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart of
the first.	75.7596
At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be
amused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the
second volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, "How pleasant it
is to spend an evening in this way!	49.3054
When they repaired to the
dining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take
the place, which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by
her sister.	41.6607
He will be forgot, and we shall
all be as we were before."	32.3209
It had been settled in the evening, between the aunt and niece, that
such a striking civility as Miss Darcy's, in coming to them on the very
day of her arrival at Pemberley, for she had reached it only to a late
breakfast, ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled, by
some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that it
would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following
morning.	38.8265
It was then disclosed in the following
manner.	28.7679
She danced four
dances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house,
and has since dined in company with him four times.	63.6008
Elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the
eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been
heard of the fugitives.	65.8408
_I_ never saw such capacity, and taste, and
application, and elegance, as you describe, united."	42.8209
"And they are really to be married!"	36.0170
CHAPTER XVII.	15.1432
Having now a good house and very sufficient income, he intended to
marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had
a wife in view, as he meant to chuse one of the daughters, if he found
them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report.	73.0867
what felicity!	118.2877
He had some intention, he added, of studying the law,
     and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would
     be a very insufficient support therein.	41.8366
Your sisters are engaged, and there is not
another woman in the room, whom it would not be a punishment to me to
stand up with."	37.9174
But I must tell you how it went off.	24.1233
have you heard from my uncle?"	40.4468
You see on
what a footing we are.	79.1912
Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth
again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many enquiries to
make after all their Hertfordshire friends.	76.3016
Miss Lucas is married and settled.	32.2756
1.E.8.	244.9414
She knew not what to think, nor how to
account for it.	27.5750
They are not married,
     nor can I find there was any intention of being so; but if you are
     willing to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on
     your side, I hope it will not be long before they are.	42.5431
"You are a good girl;" he replied, "and I have great pleasure in
thinking you will be so happily settled.	50.7475
He
cannot afford it.	20.8277
I fancy she was wanted about the mince pies.	75.7937
He did not
     leave his name, and till the next day, it was only known that a
     gentleman had called on business.	31.4250
But let me advise you to think better of it.	26.6926
She was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she
hardly knew of what.	50.2677
Not a syllable was uttered by either; and
Elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when Bingley, who as
well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering a few
words to her sister, ran out of the room.	49.4609
"Thank you," said Lydia, "for if you did, I should certainly tell you
all, and then Wickham would be angry."	38.1298
Mr. Darcy was almost as far from her, as the table
could divide them.	39.3568
I do not deserve it.	11.7774
"You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings
in this manner--in such society; and indeed I am quite of your opinion.	70.0263
CHAPTER XV.	15.1432
Mr. Wickham's chief object was unquestionably my
     sister's fortune, which is thirty thousand pounds; but I cannot
     help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me, was a
     strong inducement.	46.6562
He has been accused of many
     faults at different times; but _this_ is the true one.	81.0007
Pemberley was now Georgiana's home; and the attachment of the sisters
was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see.	78.9023
She could see him instantly before
her, in every charm of air and address; but she could remember no more
substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and
the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess.	69.0565
Even Elizabeth might have found some
trial of her patience in weather, which totally suspended the
improvement of her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and nothing less than
a dance on Tuesday, could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday and
Monday, endurable to Kitty and Lydia.	77.0367
But not long was the interval of
tranquillity; for when supper was over, singing was talked of, and she
had the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty,
preparing to oblige the company.	73.8370
But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into, was
shortly relieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by
an article of news, which then began to be in circulation.	66.1737
We may as well wait, perhaps, till the
circumstance occurs, before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour
thereupon.	85.0956
Mrs. Long told me last night that he
sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips."	56.2097
Wickham.--Wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of
     my youth, the acknowledged favourite of my father, a young man who
     had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage, and who
     had been brought up to expect its exertion, would be a depravity,
     to which the separation of two young persons, whose affection could
     be the growth of only a few weeks, could bear no comparison.--But
     from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally
     bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope to be in
     future secured, when the following account of my actions and their
     motives has been read.--If, in the explanation of them which is
     due to myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which
     may be offensive to your's, I can only say that I am sorry.--The
     necessity must be obeyed--and farther apology would be absurd.--I
     had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common with
     others, that Bingley preferred your eldest sister, to any other
     young woman in the country.--But it was not till the evening of the
     dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a
     serious attachment.--I had often seen him in love before.--At that
     ball, while I had the honour of dancing with you, I was first made
     acquainted, by Sir William Lucas's accidental information, that
     Bingley's attentions to your sister had given rise to a general
     expectation of their marriage.	67.1048
"How hard it is in some cases to be believed!"	83.3383
"She seems a very pleasant young woman," said Bingley.	25.4766
When I am in company with him, I will not be wishing.	15.8652
Their powers of conversation were considerable.	84.7974
"My dear father, I congratulate you."	10.9504
Elizabeth soon heard from her friend; and their
correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been; that it
should be equally unreserved was impossible.	79.3687
He takes them now for people of
fashion."	110.8041
This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then too
late to be saving.	56.9903
"But consider your daughters.	45.6441
Let me never see either
one or the other again!"	88.9387
He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and
fastidious, and his manners, though well bred, were not inviting.	41.8030
To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their
hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of
their dear friend's vulgar relations.	72.2188
"She
looks sickly and cross.--Yes, she will do for him very well.	44.6187
He shook his head.--"I wish I could call her amiable.	46.7554
"You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into
Hertfordshire, my dear cousin.	54.8628
He seldom appeared really
animated.	58.0184
"Let us sit down.	21.3505
Change of scene might be of
service--and perhaps a little relief from home, may be as useful as
anything."	125.1104
"Yes, madam," said Mrs. Bennet, delighted to speak to a lady Catherine.	21.4573
"This young
gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way, with every thing the heart of
mortal can most desire,--splendid property, noble kindred, and extensive
patronage.	78.6690
I am happier even than Jane; she only smiles, I
     laugh.	72.7033
She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his
aunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose
that he thought much higher of her ladyship than _she_ could do; and it
was certain, that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _one_,
whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would
address him on his weakest side.	63.3472
As for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from
the marriage of her sisters.	78.5429
Jane," cried Elizabeth, "was there a servant belonging to it, who
did not know the whole story before the end of the day?"	32.3711
II.	676.3310
I
must have my share in the conversation, if you are speaking of music.	35.1141
"Perhaps that is not possible for any one.	39.9314
Does he
know his real character?"	92.5627
The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a
secret.	49.9372
The
subject was pursued no farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went
away.	37.7209
What made you so shy of me, when you first
called, and afterwards dined here?	80.7546
CHAPTER VII.	15.1432
On this subject, what can you have to
say?	20.3876
Not these two or three years perhaps."	160.0515
In
talking over their route the evening before, Mrs. Gardiner expressed an
inclination to see the place again.	63.0404
Did you, on reading it, give any credit to its
contents?"	71.4116
The sisters, on hearing
this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how
shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked
being ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their
indifference towards Jane when not immediately before them, restored
Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike.	85.7229
"Yes, Sir, I know I am.	16.7355
You
must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them."	23.1429
The idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet I
think it is well expressed."	95.1773
Mr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the
neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that he
had yet seen, and speaking of the latter especially, with gentle but
very intelligible gallantry.	64.4138
I never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life."	45.5900
"What should not you mind?"	46.8535
That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable
resentment, as to refuse his daughter a privilege, without which her
marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all that she could believe
possible.	85.8850
The tumult of her mind was now painfully great.	31.7542
"It was the prospect of constant society, and good society," he added,
"which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire.	46.7476
It was some consolation to
think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the next,
and a still greater, that in less than a fortnight she should herself be
with Jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her
spirits, by all that affection could do.	62.0797
Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly.	177.4583
They were of course all intending to be surprised; but their
astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of Mrs.
Bennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even
inferior to what Elizabeth felt.	46.3643
We are not on friendly terms,
and it always gives me pain to meet him, but I have no reason for
avoiding _him_ but what I might proclaim to all the world; a sense of
very great ill usage, and most painful regrets at his being what he is.	58.0986
I would
rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere.	81.3269
Did you ever hear Darcy mention the
circumstance, when you were in Kent?"	54.3240
Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately.	38.7786
The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.	124.3565
Two
inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole; one, that
Elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief; and the other, that
she herself had been barbarously used by them all; and on these two
points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day.	74.8073
At length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcels
placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready.	64.3148
"There _is_ something a little stately in him to be sure," replied her
aunt, "but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming.	40.7546
But here he was set right by Mrs. Bennet, who assured
him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good
cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen.	53.9289
Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sense
of pleasure was lost in shame.	42.8808
Her astonishment at his coming--at his
coming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again,
was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered
behaviour in Derbyshire.	61.4905
Colonel Forster gives us reason
     to expect him here soon.	84.2930
By you, I was properly humbled.	50.7429
"We will go as far as Meryton with you," said Catherine and
Lydia.--Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set
off together.	56.1187
If, as I conclude will be the case, you send me full powers to act
     in your name, throughout the whole of this business, I will
     immediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper
     settlement.	76.3328
So, he enquired who she was, and got introduced, and
asked her for the two next.	64.1942
1.E.4.	283.4892
"His pride," said Miss Lucas, "does not offend _me_ so much as pride
often does, because there is an excuse for it.	38.0529
Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject.	55.2174
Bingley was every
thing that was charming, except the professed lover of her daughter.	54.2237
After walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was
tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and
look into the park.	39.2436
Mr. Collins's present
circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom
they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were
exceedingly fair.	88.3914
Elizabeth made no answer.	8.4108
Such a disappointment!	56.9978
"When you have killed all your own birds, Mr. Bingley," said her mother,
"I beg you will come here, and shoot as many as you please, on Mr.
Bennet's manor.	37.8763
He did every
thing best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds on
the first of September, than any body else in the country.	35.3500
Had he done his duty in that
respect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle, for whatever of
honour or credit could now be purchased for her.	45.0179
Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly an hundred
thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate,
but did not live to do it.--Mr.	48.2060
From herself to Jane--from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in a line
which soon brought to her recollection that Mr. Darcy's explanation
_there_, had appeared very insufficient; and she read it again.	73.0475
Oh, Lizzy!	21.1518
He is the kind
of man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse any thing, which he
condescended to ask.	32.9915
But if _we_ do not venture, somebody else will; and after
all, Mrs. Long and her nieces must stand their chance; and therefore, as
she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I will
take it on myself."	61.6494
It has
connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling.	100.9845
"How nicely we are crammed in!"	114.2009
"I shall not say that you are mistaken," he replied, "because you could
not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and I
have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know, that you
find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact
are not your own."	64.1250
It mortifies me.	101.4559
"That it ought not to be attempted.	19.5054
They must be a great loss to _your_ family."	32.8805
When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her
hand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a
simpleton and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant
in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence.	62.8078
Lydia's intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten; every sister
except Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr. Collins was to attend them,
at the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him,
and have his library to himself; for thither Mr. Collins had followed
him after breakfast, and there he would continue, nominally engaged with
one of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr.
Bennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford.	60.0545
"About a month," said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject
drop, added, "He is a man of very large property in Derbyshire, I
understand."	56.0046
By tea-time however the dose had been enough, and Mr. Bennet was glad to
take his guest into the drawing-room again, and when tea was over, glad
to invite him to read aloud to the ladies.	47.3719
You know pretty well, I suppose,
     what has been done for the young people.	32.5085
"Heaven forbid!--_That_ would be the greatest misfortune of all!--To
find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate!--Do not wish me
such an evil."	94.3595
She had only to say in
reply, that they had wandered about, till she was beyond her own
knowledge.	36.5594
Haggerston has our directions, and
     all will be completed in a week.	113.4467
At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless
precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies."	60.4486
She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making
signs of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued however
impenetrably grave.	87.4934
These
bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had I with greater policy
concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of my being
impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by
reflection, by every thing.	79.6894
Mary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was necessarily
drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs. Bennet's being quite
unable to sit alone.	77.1653
He is not at all liked in
Hertfordshire.	21.7080
I rather wonder now at your knowing _any_."	226.4257
only think!	54.8631
"Good Heaven!	40.6780
I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of
that noble place.	47.2054
"Dining out," said Mrs. Bennet, "that is very unlucky."	75.6171
She answered him in the usual
way, and after a moment's pause, added,

"My eldest sister has been in town these three months.	45.2335
Her resistance had not
injured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some
complacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley,

"I can guess the subject of your reverie."	43.8176
Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards a table
where a few books were lying.	54.5215
Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her
implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who
answered this description, when Mr. Hurst called them to order, with
bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward.	92.3301
Steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke
ten words to her through the whole of Saturday, and though they were at
one time left by themselves for half an hour, he adhered most
conscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her.	87.5826
thought Elizabeth.	40.7599
The feelings
of the person who wrote, and the person who received it, are now so
widely different from what they were then, that every unpleasant
circumstance attending it, ought to be forgotten.	61.6362
Their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the Lucases
came to meet Maria and hear the news: and various were the subjects
which occupied them; lady Lucas was enquiring of Maria across the table,
after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter; Mrs. Bennet was
doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an account of the present
fashions from Jane, who sat some way below her, and on the other,
retailing them all to the younger Miss Lucases; and Lydia, in a voice
rather louder than any other person's, was enumerating the various
pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her.	90.8852
my dear Lydia," she cried, "when shall we meet again?"	63.8691
I hear such different
accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly."	124.7729
"You never will be able to make both
of them good for any thing.	35.0114
"No, indeed.	33.5262
Your mother must
have been quite a slave to your education."	49.0902
"How I long to see her again!	47.6034
Darcy.--_I_ talked about
the dance, and _you_ ought to make some kind of remark on the size of
the room, or the number of couples."	50.1329
Not all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five
daughters, could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her
husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley.	45.0328
She was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and
turned away with a degree of ill humour, which she could not wholly
surmount even in speaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind partiality
provoked her.	35.8330
Mrs. Bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with many
expressions of concern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere.	53.9833
"_That_ will make your ladyship's situation at present more pitiable;
but it will have no effect on _me_."	61.7762
Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.	149.4286
"I assure you there is quite as much of _that_
going on in the country as in town."	39.7498
But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends
to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies."	64.3636
"Poor Wickham; there is such an expression of goodness in his
countenance!	53.7150
He has also _brotherly_ pride,
which with _some_ brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and careful
guardian of his sister; and you will hear him generally cried up as the
most attentive and best of brothers."	95.8201
But why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more difficult
to understand.	54.3194
Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete
victory over him, continued her triumph.	45.1877
Miss Lucas perceived
him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and instantly
set out to meet him accidentally in the lane.	63.1303
He added, that Mr.
Bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present, to leave London, and
promised to write again very soon.	33.2959
"It is amazing to me," said Bingley, "how young ladies can have patience
to be so very accomplished, as they all are."	46.7188
"He
only told me, what I have now told you."	27.5133
Mr. Collins
was employed in agreeing to every thing her Ladyship said, thanking her
for every fish he won, and apologising if he thought he won too many.	54.3959
They were not the only objects of Mr. Collins's admiration.	22.3271
I am glad it occurred to me to mention
it; for it would really be discreditable to _you_ to let them go alone."	42.5028
And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in greater
beauty.	31.6200
"Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought," said Mrs.
Bennet; "and if I were to see you at it I should take away your bottle
directly."	51.0144
Mr. Bennet's expectations were fully answered.	39.4831
"I would not be so fastidious as you are," cried Bingley, "for a
kingdom!	46.6670
Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his
countenance.	65.6328
"My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so
much?"	47.7133
"Dear madam," cried Mrs. Hill, in great astonishment, "don't you know
there is an express come for master from Mr. Gardiner?	61.7220
CHAPTER XIII.	15.1432
After walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to know
any thing about it, they found at last, on examining their watches, that
it was time to be at home.	53.3279
With his notions of dignity, he would
probably feel that the arguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weak
and ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.	97.2835
It suddenly struck her that it might
be from lady Catherine; and she anticipated with dismay all the
consequent explanations.	47.5390
The
evening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of its
animation, and almost all its sense, by the absence of Jane and
Elizabeth.	42.7167
Are any of your
younger sisters out, Miss Bennet?"	85.5728
You will not, I hope, consider me as shewing any disrespect to your
family, my dear Madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your
daughter's favour, without having paid yourself and Mr. Bennet the
compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf.	57.4549
He could not help
seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in
the room.	40.4243
She then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the
card party, and was sitting up stairs with Kitty.	42.4382
But Jane knows, as well as I do, what
Wickham really is.	42.5227
He confessed himself
     obliged to leave the regiment, on account of some debts of honour,
     which were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the
     ill-consequences of Lydia's flight, on her own folly alone.	53.9829
"My aunt," she continued, "is going to-morrow into that part of the
town, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor-street."	35.4513
Any thing beyond
the very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far."	45.3269
CHAPTER XXII.	15.1432
I am not to be intimidated into
anything so wholly unreasonable.	41.0824
Colonel
Fitzwilliam's occasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was
generally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told
her; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of
love, and the object of that love, her friend Eliza, she sat herself
seriously to work to find it out.--She watched him whenever they were at
Rosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much success.	56.8954
However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his
first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds
of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful
property of some one or other of their daughters.	90.8122
I cannot
acquit him of that duty; nor could I think well of the man who should
omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected
with the family."	77.2237
"Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia's note to his
wife?"	56.0217
He had ruined for a
while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart
in the world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have
inflicted.	83.0376
How grievous then was the thought that, of a situation so
desirable in every respect, so replete with advantage, so promising for
happiness, Jane had been deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own
family!	88.8349
Have you seen any pleasant men?	64.0091
"Oh!"	7.8559
I
might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little _endeavour_ at
civility, I am thus rejected.	94.7970
Why should they not go on to Scotland, if that had been the
case?"	54.9069
When this was
done, she had a less active part to play.	68.8377
They are young in the ways
of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that
handsome young men must have something to live on, as well as the
plain."	54.1677
This must be the grossest falsehood!"	70.4980
Is nothing due to me on that
score?	56.4182
By Elizabeth's instructions she began to comprehend that a
woman may take liberties with her husband, which a brother will not
always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself.	100.0659
If you do not choose to understand me, forgive my
     impertinence.	35.0107
I can remember some expressions which might
justly make you hate me."	79.3798
He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his reading
Mr. Collins's letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed her
at last to go--saying, as she quitted the room, "If any young men come
for Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at leisure."	52.2508
dear, yes;--but you must own she is very plain.	49.5380
Elizabeth reserved to herself the
application for her mother's.	51.3196
It was a fortnight since Mrs. Bennet had been down stairs, but on this
happy day, she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in
spirits oppressively high.	46.3964
After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health, good
humour and cheerfulness began to re-appear at Longbourn.	47.8706
He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest."	118.4815
I
     thought too ill of him, to invite him to Pemberley, or admit his
     society in town.	50.9368
"Lady Catherine, I have nothing farther to say.	13.4993
He meant to provide for me amply,
and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given
elsewhere."	40.0121
Not that I mean to find fault with _you_, for such things
I know are all chance in this world.	74.8069
CHAPTER XVI.	15.1432
Where does discretion end,
and avarice begin?	150.6934
72 of La Belle Assemblee 1^{st} July 1815_]




PRIDE & PREJUDICE.	426.2437
Mr. Bingley arrived.	13.2700
It was reasonable, however, to
hope, that they would not continue long.	25.9262
She had not been many hours at home, before she found that the Brighton
scheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under
frequent discussion between her parents.	48.4418
I am not romantic you know.	31.8404
I feel as if I had never done you justice, or loved you as you
deserve."	56.7459
Mr. Collins and Charlotte appeared at
the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate, which led by a
short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of the whole
party.	49.8378
In what a
disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man!	143.8373
PRIDE AND PREJUDICE:

A Novel.	54.6230
They
are my old friends.	76.8924
Miss Lydia is going to be married; and you shall
all have a bowl of punch, to make merry at her wedding."	55.2661
"No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton."	43.6444
She had heard nothing of
Lady Catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or
miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money and rank, she
thought she could witness without trepidation.	82.1870
They were all astonished; and Mr. Bennet, who could by no means wish for
so speedy a return, immediately said,

"But is there not danger of Lady Catherine's disapprobation here, my
good sir?--You had better neglect your relations, than run the risk of
offending your patroness."	67.2407
_You_
may ask questions, which _I_ shall not choose to answer."	21.6034
And in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all,
since you went away.	30.0079
I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow to hear more
about it, and to ask when Mr. Denny comes back from town."	58.8516
Stop me whilst you can."	238.4543
I am glad he dines here on Tuesday.	47.8488
I could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and as for
Purvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful."	65.7299
Miss Bingley's attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr.
Darcy's progress through _his_ book, as in reading her own; and she was
perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page.	60.1813
"Is it possible!"	27.6797
His fear of her, has always operated, I
know, when they were together; and a good deal is to be imputed to his
wish of forwarding the match with Miss De Bourgh, which I am certain he
has very much at heart."	44.3683
Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply; but unable to contain
herself, began scolding one of her daughters.	41.8265
I shall send for my
     clothes when I get to Longbourn; but I wish you would tell Sally
     to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown, before they are
     packed up.	91.3297
In society so superior to what she had generally
known, her improvement was great.	89.3971
Very few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to Rosings, and
not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise;
and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings
to be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many
hours.	52.5337
But when she read, and re-read with the closest attention, the
particulars immediately following of Wickham's resigning all pretensions
to the living, of his receiving in lieu, so considerable a sum as three
thousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate.	78.6106
She was
sorry that Mr. Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so
little suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the
unhappiness which her sister's refusal must have given him.	58.9198
Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer
above-mentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their
carriage, Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on
Elizabeth's person, behaviour, and dress.	82.6840
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.	110.8505
My
watchfulness has been effectual; and though I should certainly be a more
interesting object to all my acquaintance, were I distractedly in love
with him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance.	47.9791
"You write uncommonly fast."	45.2469
Mrs. Hurst and Miss
Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who
continued, though slowly, to mend; and in the evening Elizabeth joined
their party in the drawing-room.	41.4253
The perpetual
commendations of the lady either on his hand-writing, or on the evenness
of his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern
with which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was
exactly in unison with her opinion of each.	77.7975
would they
often exclaim in the bitterness of woe.	63.6304
"If one could but go to Brighton!"	58.0754
But above all, above respect and esteem,
there was a motive within her of good will which could not be
overlooked.	77.3954
"It will be _her_ turn soon to be teazed," said Miss Lucas.	26.8341
Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said
nothing.	34.9398
It was first broken by Mrs. Annesley, a
genteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind
of discourse, proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the
others; and between her and Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional help from
Elizabeth, the conversation was carried on.	69.8142
Bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr. Bennet spent the
morning together, as had been agreed on.	66.7553
And then we were so merry all the way home!	53.8852
"It taught me to hope," said he, "as I had scarcely ever allowed myself
to hope before.	56.6525
Mrs. Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while
Sir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings
found a rapid vent.	53.5453
They will
ruin your happiness.	43.0208
"I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind.	24.6452
Her
mother only scolded her for being nonsensical.	99.1478
Mrs. Gardiner, who was
walking arm in arm with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of her
wonder.	53.9439
From something that he told me in
our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to
him.	66.7184
I wish I could see her.	30.3614
The Collinses will turn us out, before he is cold
in his grave; and if you are not kind to us, brother, I do not know what
we shall do."	32.4856
Lydia's voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and
she ran into the room.	40.6909
What a good joke it will be!	74.4530
They could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr.
Bingley's large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their
mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of
an ensign.	64.9795
Till this moment, I never knew myself."	34.7249
Darcy said
nothing at all.	25.0459
The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family.	76.8193
Stupid men are the only ones
worth knowing, after all."	175.0682

As soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the following
manner:--

"You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of my
journey hither.	32.6373
Elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the
commission of the peace for the county, she was a most active magistrate
in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by
Mr. Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be
quarrelsome, discontented or too poor, she sallied forth into the
village to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold
them into harmony and plenty.	86.5460
If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.	79.3118
"Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh," said
Elizabeth.	26.4011
"You may depend upon it, Madam," said Miss Bingley, with cold civility,
"that Miss Bennet shall receive every possible attention while she
remains with us."	36.5535
I know my dear uncle and
     aunt so well, that I am not afraid of requesting it, though I have
     still something more to ask of the former.	30.6268
1.F.2.	252.1295
The day passed much as the day before had done.	73.1853
For
my part, Mr. Bingley, _I_ always keep servants that can do their own
work; _my_ daughters are brought up differently.	88.6593
It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an
indirect boast."	72.2517
Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of a
great opposition of character.--Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the
easiness, openness, ductility of his temper, though no disposition could
offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he never
appeared dissatisfied.	80.5663
Bennet.--They had several children.	120.4353
oh!	7.8559
Since such were her
     feelings, it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a
     marriage, which, in his very first conversation with Wickham, he
     easily learnt, had never been _his_ design.	83.8566
I was so vexed to see him stand
up with her; but, however, he did not admire her at all: indeed, nobody
can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going
down the dance.	56.2946
The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so
soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be
safe for her--that she was not enough recovered; but Jane was firm where
she felt herself to be right.	42.1635
"From the very beginning, from the first moment I may almost say, of my
acquaintance with you, your manners impressing me with the fullest
belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the
feelings of others, were such as to form that ground-work of
disapprobation, on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a
dislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the
last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry."	68.6460
One day's delay she observed,
would be of small importance; and her mother was too happy, to be quite
so obstinate as usual.	52.2437
"I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this--though I have never liked
him, I had not thought so very ill of him--I had supposed him to be
despising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of
descending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as
this!"	66.2361
Your's, &c.

     "EDW.	58.1999
1813.	15.1432
The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases, and again during the
chief of the day, was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr. Collins.	28.1865
But in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that
cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style, and which,
proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself, and kindly
disposed towards every one, had been scarcely ever clouded.	62.6532
What congratulations will
then flow in!	216.3484
CHAPTER XI.	15.1432
_He_ shall be
mercenary, and _she_ shall be foolish."	29.0517
Mr. Darcy had been at her
sister's wedding.	17.2338
How differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned!	69.3370
Elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first
convenient pause, turned to him with an arch smile, and said,

"You mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this state to hear
me?	49.2400
In another minute Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what
passed, took leave and rode on with his friend.	92.2794
Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction--and a moment's
consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it
over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again, and tried
to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided
between distress and diversion.	85.9316
"And I have another favour to ask.	37.9048
His pride
never deserts him; but with the rich, he is liberal-minded, just,
sincere, rational, honourable, and perhaps agreeable,--allowing
something for fortune and figure."	122.8100
I should be sorry to think so
ill of him, in the very beginning of our relationship."	26.9665
"Yes, Sir; but I do not know when _that_ will be.	28.3211
Excuse me--for I must speak plainly.	65.9681
Mr. Bingley was
unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be
civil also, and say what the occasion required.	69.4291
To know
that her daughter would be married was enough.	43.8432
cried Elizabeth.	11.7380
CHAPTER I.	15.1432
cried Elizabeth, "I am excessively diverted.	30.3044
"Well," said Charlotte, "I wish Jane success with all my heart; and if
she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a
chance of happiness, as if she were to be studying his character for a
twelvemonth.	41.0973
Respect,
esteem, and confidence, had vanished for ever; and all his views of
domestic happiness were overthrown.	100.3413
"This fine account of him," whispered her aunt, as they walked, "is not
quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend."	44.3523
They have at
least that advantage."	42.6926
Thoughtless and indiscreet I
     can easily believe him, but this step (and let us rejoice over it)
     marks nothing bad at heart.	71.4637
"Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last November,
he really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of _my_ being
indifferent, would have prevented his coming down again!"	53.7287
"With great energy;--but it is a subject which always makes a lady
energetic."	95.6880
She owed
her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who often joined them, and
good-naturedly engaged Mr. Collins's conversation to herself.	50.9096
Had his own happiness, however, been
the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in what
ever manner he thought best; but her sister's was involved in it, as she
thought he must be sensible himself.	47.9377
Darcy made no answer.	12.1563
Jane, I take your place now, and you must go
lower, because I am a married woman."	48.2414
My faults, according to this
calculation, are heavy indeed!	86.8368
He has
     more to give.	29.9432
I do think it is the hardest thing
in the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own
children; and I am sure if I had been you, I should have tried long ago
to do something or other about it."	41.0350
"Oh!	7.8559
More than once did Elizabeth in her ramble within the Park, unexpectedly
meet Mr.	103.8202
All that is
     required of you is, to assure to your daughter, by settlement, her
     equal share of the five thousand pounds, secured among your
     children after the decease of yourself and my sister; and,
     moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her, during your
     life, one hundred pounds per annum.	79.6356
His diffidence had
prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case, but
his reliance on mine, made every thing easy.	68.7273
They then went away.	14.7947
But I must write no more.	18.2181
"And quite alone?	89.7185
"And Lydia used to want to go to London," added Kitty.	49.4898
"What do you mean, Hill?	23.0240
But we are all liable to
error.	33.9604
The looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were
discussed, except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention.	81.8864

Section 4.	279.4979
The favour of your company has been much felt, I assure you.	43.0305
"Whatever my connections may be," said Elizabeth, "if your nephew does
not object to them, they can be nothing to _you_."	39.1917
Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her
father, their indignation would hardly have found expression in their
united volubility.	83.4190
"MY DEAR NIECE,

     "I have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole
     morning to answering it, as I foresee that a _little_ writing will
     not comprise what I have to tell you.	54.0064
With astonishment did Elizabeth see, that her new
acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself.	63.4796
Jane now came up.	47.5861
Tell him I hope he will
     excuse me when he knows all, and tell him I will dance with him at
     the next ball we meet, with great pleasure.	61.5206
cried Elizabeth, when she had finished.	12.9311
Could she have seen half as much love in Mr. Darcy
for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes.	52.8439
We must not make him desperate."	21.5191
She had instinctively turned away; but, stopping on his approach,
received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be
overcome.	71.1033
Mrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked
her, if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends.	40.5961
She was then but
     fifteen, which must be her excuse; and after stating her
     imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed the knowledge of it to
     herself.	44.2077
"I am more likely to want time than courage, Elizabeth.	87.0430
I have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of
thing.--Young women should always be properly guarded and attended,
according to their situation in life.	65.6791
Oh!	7.8559
Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs. Bennet: one
communication would, therefore, do for all.	82.5823
One may be continually
abusive without saying any thing just; but one cannot be always laughing
at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty."	79.4436
"None at all.	34.1258
By the Author of "Sense and Sensibility."	21.9071
Mr. Darcy is
engaged to _my daughter_.	19.1815
The first mentioned
     was, that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached
     Mr. Bingley from your sister,--and the other, that I had, in
     defiance of various claims, in defiance of honour and humanity,
     ruined the immediate prosperity, and blasted the prospects of Mr.	61.8713
When this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, Mr.
Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much
struck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he
might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour
at Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much
gratification; but when Mrs. Philips understood from him what Rosings
was, and who was its proprietor, when she had listened to the
description of only one of Lady Catherine's drawing-rooms, and found
that the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all
the force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison
with the housekeeper's room.	74.1615
It
was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when Mr. Collins joining
in, observed,

"Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine
de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not say you will
be delighted with her.	40.5256
to
put me on my guard?	49.6192
Let me recommend you, however, as a friend,
not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr.
Darcy's using him ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he
has been always remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has
treated Mr. Darcy in a most infamous manner.	52.6538
And since this sad
affair has taken place, it is said, that he left Meryton greatly in
debt; but I hope this may be false."	85.2036
You will have a charming mother-in-law, indeed, and
of course she will be always at Pemberley with you."	37.3602
What a fine thing for our girls!"	111.3923
for she only came, I suppose, to tell us the Collinses were well.	48.3394
"My dear, you flatter me.	16.5950
CHAPTER IX.	15.1432
His disposition must
be dreadful."	34.8209
Soon after
     you left me on Saturday, I was fortunate enough to find out in what
     part of London they were.	52.9459
She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country.	19.6939
But really, and upon my
honour, I will try to do what I think to be wisest; and now, I hope you
are satisfied."	37.9052
They battled it
     together for a long time, which was more than either the gentleman
     or lady concerned in it deserved.	93.6952
You _are_ a gentleman's daughter.	30.6272
"You have said quite enough, madam.	33.1778
Would to heaven that any
thing could be either said or done on my part, that might offer
consolation to such distress.--But I will not torment you with vain
wishes, which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks.	85.0926
"You mistake me, my dear.	24.3626
She was met in the vestibule by Lydia, who, flying to
her, cried in a half whisper, "I am glad you are come, for there is such
fun here!--What do you think has happened this morning?--Mr.	40.9292
The garden sloping to the road,
the house standing in it, the green pales and the laurel hedge, every
thing declared they were arriving.	62.0564
Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified,
never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting.	112.4140
Darcy, after enquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner did, a question
which she could not answer without confusion, said scarcely any thing.	50.7410
"Lizzy," said he, "I was going to look for you; come into my room."	26.7427
"I am very glad to hear such a good account of her," said Lady
Catherine; "and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel,
if she does not practise a great deal."	27.6255
Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his
cousin's praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she
discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss
De Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley, that he might have
been just as likely to marry _her_, had she been his relation.	54.6613
"Lady Catherine de Bourgh," she replied, "has very lately given him a
living.	45.1401
- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.	81.1375
But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend,
where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no
very great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying
with the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?"	90.3448
This was
very amiable, but Charlotte's kindness extended farther than Elizabeth
had any conception of;--its object was nothing less, than to secure her
from any return of Mr. Collins's addresses, by engaging them towards
herself.	75.1914
Of Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far
as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find.	59.7564
After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel
of this event, which Elizabeth considered as all but certain, and Miss
Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible; the former continued
the subject, by saying, "But tell me all and every thing about it, which
I have not already heard.	72.3153
I thought I should have broke my heart."	30.9715
He had not
a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sort of
preference which was often given me."	67.9798
He could tell her nothing new of the
wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities were worn
out like his information.	81.5051
She was quite amazed
at her own discomposure; but amongst other causes of disquiet, she
dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in
her favour; and more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally
suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her.	76.7271
no--it is not for _me_ to be driven away by Mr. Darcy.	39.0966
Well, well, I only hope it
will last.	50.5862
"No, nothing at all."	35.2934
But perhaps," added he, stopping in his
walk, and turning towards her, "these offences might have been
overlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the
scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design.	95.3270
You must and shall be married by a special licence.	59.5891
Mr. Bennet treated the matter differently.	25.4286
Mr. Darcy asked him why he had not married your
     sister at once.	46.3562
That he is
as false and deceitful, as he is insinuating."	55.2127
I do not know who is
good enough for him."	18.0274
Little more than half a day's
journey.	115.9807
"But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure.	26.3150
Her cousin prefaced his speech with
a solemn bow, and though she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if
hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words "apology,"
"Hunsford," and "Lady Catherine de Bourgh."	38.5869
Who would
have thought of my meeting with--perhaps--a nephew of Lady Catherine de
Bourgh in this assembly!--I am most thankful that the discovery is made
in time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to do,
and trust he will excuse my not having done it before.	63.0840
"Are you quite sure, Ma'am?--is not there a little mistake?"	66.0945
If he had been so very
agreeable he would have talked to Mrs. Long.	23.2250
It was the favourite wish of
_his_ mother, as well as of her's.	33.6670
Well, I was so frightened I did not
know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away; and if we were beyond
the hour, we could not be married all day.	35.1795
Mr.
     Darcy called, and was shut up with him several hours.	55.4238
They are all for what they can get.	49.8132
March was to take
Elizabeth to Hunsford.	126.6953
I do not believe she often sees such at home."	33.4854
I believed you to be
wishing, expecting my addresses."	40.8691
He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin
could refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other
way.	72.8447
"I would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one; but I always speak
what I think."	44.6572
She was not the better pleased with his
gallantry, from the idea it suggested of something more.--It now first
struck her, that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy of
being the mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a
quadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors.	69.0693
"I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the _appearance_ of it as you
used to do."	39.5210
The sanguine hope of good,
however, which the benevolence of her heart suggested, had not yet
deserted her; she still expected that it would all end well, and that
every morning would bring some letter, either from Lydia or her father,
to explain their proceedings, and perhaps announce the marriage.	71.1387
"Your's, &c."

This letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned as she
considered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least.	81.0630
Though I
shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill; and if I was
her, I would not have put up with it.	54.2995
She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia's general
behaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of
such a woman as Mrs. Forster, and the probability of her being yet more
imprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the temptations must
be greater than at home.	58.7052
Every body is disgusted with his pride.	37.8504
An
airing would do me a great deal of good, I am sure.	33.7936
I know how much
you dislike him."	20.3802
Be so kind as to apologize for us to Miss Darcy.	49.2515
"I beg your pardon;--one knows exactly what to think."	76.9570
Every thing was too recent for
gaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer any
thing material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity
would come in time.	81.4238
Bingley?"	32.6354
But it
was her business to be satisfied--and certainly her temper to be happy;
and all was soon right again.	69.5833
He was received by Mrs.
Bennet with a degree of civility, which made her two daughters ashamed,
especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of
her curtsey and address to his friend.	69.6090
Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he
may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on."	53.6746
No man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his
character, could be capable of it.	42.3011
"Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would not be
near so much like a ball."	33.5989
cried Maria, after a few minutes silence, "it seems but
a day or two since we first came!--and yet how many things have
happened!"	86.0755
Wont it, Kitty?"	66.3687
She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings,
and had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool of
quadrille in the evening.	48.9022
I have been a
selfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle.	41.5569
He then asked her to walk into the house--but she declared herself not
tired, and they stood together on the lawn.	38.6709
This is not
the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his
wife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true
philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.	98.8343
But
at least it shews, that _she_ was serious in the object of her journey.	24.9046
"Certainly not; at first.	30.0914
His debts to be discharged, and something still to remain!	67.0044
It soothed,
but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus
self-attracted by the rest of her family;--and as she considered that
Jane's disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest
relations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt
by such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond any thing she
had ever known before.	59.6681
But the fact is, that we are very
different sort of men, and that he hates me."	40.3289
"Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me.--No one who has ever seen you
together, can doubt his affection.	60.1758
GARDINER."	55.4642
Elizabeth walked on in quest
of the only face whose features would be known to her.	41.0131
You can hardly doubt the purport
of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to
dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken.	114.1980
"I have heard much of your master's fine person," said Mrs. Gardiner,
looking at the picture; "it is a handsome face.	36.7725
"If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise, should come to
his friend within a few days," she added, "I shall know how to
understand it.	37.8934
Can you, yourself, Lizzy, so wholly give him up, as to believe
him capable of it?"	40.5841
"Well, well," said he, "do not make yourself unhappy.	24.3570
In short, my dear aunt, I
should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but
since we see every day that where there is affection, young people are
seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune, from entering into
engagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so many
of my fellow creatures if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that it
would be wisdom to resist?	82.1554
Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked too!)	69.2776
"Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed," added
Charlotte, "and a most attentive neighbour."	68.9078
Mr. Darcy's
shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict, gave her a
keener sense of her sister's sufferings.	40.3568
She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet's height, or
rather taller."	73.8345
Surprise was the least
of her feelings on this developement.	61.5882
A person may be
proud without being vain.	109.5590
There is but one part of my conduct in the
     whole affair, on which I do not reflect with satisfaction; it is
     that I condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to
     conceal from him your sister's being in town.	48.5506
The idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing
civilities toward herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a
compliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than
gratified herself, by this effect of her charms, it was not long before
her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage
was exceedingly agreeable to _her_.	74.6389
Mr. Bingley was good looking and gentleman-like; he had a pleasant
countenance, and easy, unaffected manners.	60.7067
"You have a very small park here," returned Lady Catherine after a short
silence.	51.1271
"Yes--if Darcy does not put it off again.	53.8826
and his
answering immediately to the last question--Oh!	83.8614
Mrs. Bennet's eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was
eagerly calling out, while her daughter read,

"Well, Jane, who is it from?	39.8911
Mrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the
library.	25.6981
"Yes, yes, they must marry.	20.0569
I am only distressed by
some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn."	58.2655
The general prejudice against Mr. Darcy is so violent,
that it would be the death of half the good people in Meryton, to
attempt to place him in an amiable light.	47.2245
Not Lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after
the first exclamations of surprise and horror, Mr. Gardiner readily
promised every assistance in his power.--Elizabeth, though expecting no
less, thanked him with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated
by one spirit, every thing relating to their journey was speedily
settled.	96.6307
That had
his actions been what Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of
every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and
that friendship between a person capable of it, and such an amiable man
as Mr. Bingley, was incomprehensible.	70.4264
"There can be no doubt of that.	20.8151
There is a lady, it seems, a
     Mrs. Younge, who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy, and was
     dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation, though
     he did not say what.	52.0819
He generously imputed the whole to his
     mistaken pride, and confessed that he had before thought it beneath
     him, to lay his private actions open to the world.	85.9204
Elizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her
ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself.	38.3289
He is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably."	51.7827
After an affectionate
parting between the friends, Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by
Mr. Collins, and as they walked down the garden, he was commissioning
her with his best respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks
for the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter, and his
compliments to Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, though unknown.	46.0762
She
could think of nothing else, and yet whether Bingley's regard had really
died away, or were suppressed by his friends' interference; whether he
had been aware of Jane's attachment, or whether it had escaped his
observation; whichever were the case, though her opinion of him must be
materially affected by the difference, her sister's situation remained
the same, her peace equally wounded.	80.0879
Lydia was
occasionally a visitor there, when her husband was gone to enjoy himself
in London or Bath; and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently
staid so long, that even Bingley's good humour was overcome, and he
proceeded so far as to _talk_ of giving them a hint to be gone.	57.0716
In
truth I must acknowledge that, with all the disadvantages of this humble
parsonage, I should not think any one abiding in it an object of
compassion, while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings."	64.3622
Can she be ignorant of what you
and Jane seem so well to understand?"	73.9727
no.--I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same
feelings."	48.8675
Risk any thing rather than her
displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us
again, which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home,
and be satisfied that _we_ shall take no offence."	62.2337
I am very, very sorry.	33.1474
When her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she followed her,
and made the important communication.	44.0166
At last it
arrested her--and she beheld a striking resemblance of Mr. Darcy, with
such a smile over the face, as she remembered to have sometimes seen,
when he looked at her.	45.4347
Elizabeth's congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth, a
delight, which words could but poorly express.	106.6714
how shall I bear so much happiness!"	59.7133
And as to laughter, we will not expose
ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a subject.	47.4407
I am very sensible of the honour of
your proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline
them."	27.2092
Who is to fight Wickham,
and make him marry her, if he comes away?"	44.7129
Darcy!"	28.3342
With the Gardiners, they were always on the most intimate terms.	56.2063
Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with
much more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary, at the
end of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by
Scotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who with
some of the Lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing
at one end of the room.	83.6232
"Yet it is hard," she sometimes thought, "that this poor man cannot come
to a house, which he has legally hired, without raising all this
speculation!	97.5048
If they believed him attached to me, they would not try
to part us; if he were so, they could not succeed.	44.4281
"They
will join me early to-morrow," he continued, "and among them are some
who will claim an acquaintance with you,--Mr. Bingley and his sisters."	56.1040
"That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask.	34.0115

"I have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear Sir.	26.3475
She was proceeding
directly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. Darcy's
sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park,
she turned up the lane, which led her farther from the turnpike road.	37.0442
Their eyes
instantly met, and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest
blush.	64.8142
Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what
she did not believe herself, that his attentions to Jane had been merely
the effect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw
her no more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at
the time, she had the same story to repeat every day.	54.8204
"What an excellent father you have, girls," said she, when the door was
shut.	55.0121
The girls stared at their father.	46.1511
can it be really so!	67.2188
"Is it not clear enough?--Does it not expressly declare
that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister; that she
is perfectly convinced of her brother's indifference, and that if she
suspects the nature of my feelings for him, she means (most kindly!)	86.1702
"You may depend on it," replied the other, "for Mrs. Nicholls was in
Meryton last night; I saw her passing by, and went out myself on purpose
to know the truth of it; and she told me that it was certain true.	63.2337
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the

My kind friends will
     not hear of my returning home till I am better.	75.3805
Lady Catherine herself says
that in point of true beauty, Miss De Bourgh is far superior to the
handsomest of her sex; because there is that in her features which marks
the young woman of distinguished birth.	83.2999
She was gone directly.	16.2814
Secondly, that I am convinced it will add
very greatly to my happiness; and thirdly--which perhaps I ought to have
mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and recommendation
of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness.	67.9034
Sir William had been
delighted with him.	12.8651
For your
sake," turning to Charlotte, "I am glad of it; but otherwise I see no
occasion for entailing estates from the female line.--It was not thought
necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh's family.--Do you play and sing, Miss
Bennet?"	73.2327
The reason of this sudden
removal was soon evident.	69.7366
On his quitting the room, she sat down, unable to support herself, and
looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her,
or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration,
"Let me call your maid.	47.1195
"Oh, lord!	19.8226
"I comfort myself with thinking," replied Jane, "that he certainly would
not marry Lydia, if he had not a real regard for her.	37.8629
It was absolutely
necessary, therefore, to think of something, and in this emergence
recollecting _when_ she had seen him last in Hertfordshire, and feeling
curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty
departure, she observed,

"How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November, Mr. Darcy!	60.9487
Mr. Gardiner himself
did not expect any success from this measure, but as his brother was
eager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it.	54.0684
Mr. Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he acted
very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements.	82.7571
Mrs. Bennet, through the assistance of servants,
contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety
and fretfulness on her side, might be as long as it could.	37.3766
CHAPTER VI.	15.1432
She followed her father to the fire place, and they both sat down.	30.1156
--And
upon Elizabeth's seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about
to escape, she added, "Lizzy, I _insist_ upon your staying and hearing
Mr.	92.3231
CHAPTER XIII.	15.1432
And what claims has Lydia, what attractions has she
beyond youth, health, and good humour, that could make him for her sake,
forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well?	71.9760
Every time
they met, it was more decided and remarkable.	80.9433
Mr. Collins's return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of
pleasure to Mrs. Bennet.	38.2511
Mrs. Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before, in
the course of Jane and Elizabeth's correspondence with her, made her
sister a slight answer, and in compassion to her nieces turned the
conversation.	51.6718
Is there nothing you could take, to give you
present relief?--A glass of wine;--shall I get you one?--You are very
ill."

"No, I thank you;" she replied, endeavouring to recover herself.	96.8508
Mr. Bingley
was obliged to be in town the following day, and consequently unable to
accept the honour of their invitation, &c. Mrs. Bennet was quite
disconcerted.	29.9020
Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her
application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited
manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she
had reached.	76.0530
You have sense, and we all
expect you to use it.	49.9555
He was beyond comparison the pleasantest man; he
certainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but,
to counterbalance these advantages, Mr. Darcy had considerable patronage
in the church, and his cousin could have none at all.	67.5283
On the very last day of the regiment's remaining in Meryton, he dined
with others of the officers at Longbourn; and so little was Elizabeth
disposed to part from him in good humour, that on his making some
enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford, she
mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam's and Mr. Darcy's having both spent three
weeks at Rosings, and asked him if he were acquainted with the former.	63.9495
Well, how pleased I am!	41.9027
Lizzy, why am I thus singled from my family, and blessed
above them all!	61.9874
The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no
otherwise than by netting a purse, or covering a skreen.	125.1045
They then sat down, and when her enquiries after Rosings were made,
seemed in danger of sinking into total silence.	96.6655
He had been some days in town, before he was able to
     discover them; but he had something to direct his search, which was
     more than _we_ had; and the consciousness of this, was another
     reason for his resolving to follow us.	40.1262
"Miss Elizabeth Bennet!"	64.4893
When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye was in
search of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to bring it in view.	63.5570
I was obliged to confess
one thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him.	68.5757
She wished
to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, "This must be false!	70.4095
But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures
continued with little intermission to the very day of Lydia's leaving
home.	64.6470
"Good gracious!	33.8698
Those were your words.	134.3150
He had not been long seated
before he complimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine a family of
daughters, said he had heard much of their beauty, but that, in this
instance, fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did
not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage.	62.5118
The consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have
a daughter married before I have, and that Longbourn estate is just as
much entailed as ever.	53.0757
"I say no more than the truth, and what every body will say that knows
him," replied the other.	43.8029
But they are very pleasing women when you
converse with them.	42.5745
It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood
perfectly ignorant of what had happened.	48.4507
"And have you heard from him often?"	58.8062
"This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree.	36.9202
How shall we punish him for such a speech?"	91.5622
Her
heart did whisper, that he had done it for her.	26.0966
Your profusion
makes me saving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will
be as light as a feather."	55.0261
Elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, "To
treat in such a manner, the god-son, the friend, the favourite of his
father!"	55.9760
"To yield readily--easily--to the _persuasion_ of a friend is no merit
with you."	87.8899
1.F.3.	497.8578
In the former were many good paintings;
but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already
visible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss
Darcy's, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and
also more intelligible.	82.5996
She felt anew the justice of Mr. Darcy's
objections; and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his
interference in the views of his friend.	41.7081
"I cannot see why Mrs. Forster should not ask _me_ as well as Lydia,"
said she, "though I am _not_ her particular friend.	28.5810

Assistance is impossible; condolence,
insufferable.	466.9598
Mr. Collins no sooner saw the two
girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which
Charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked
to dine at Rosings the next day.	47.3692
We acted with the best intentions."	44.2442
My mind was more
agreeably engaged.	54.4534
He knows where we live.	47.1969

CHAPTER III.	15.1432
It was
impossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its
owner.	38.9019
She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle
and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way.	57.0778
Wickham only shook his head.	40.3149
I write without any intention of paining you, or humbling
     myself, by dwelling on wishes, which, for the happiness of both,
     cannot be too soon forgotten; and the effort which the formation,
     and the perusal of this letter must occasion, should have been
     spared, had not my character required it to be written and read.	63.0892
Her mother
would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone.	44.6746
"But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that
neighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model.	57.4419
He acknowledged the truth of it all; and said that
business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours
before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling.	52.2660
and so
she asked the two Harringtons to come, but Harriet was ill, and so Pen
was forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did?	53.4830
If you
were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to quit the sphere,
in which you have been brought up."	33.1900
do not repeat what I then said.	86.4589
She saw the indelicacy of putting
himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions
with his conduct.	39.9656
He assured her that as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it;
that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to
her, and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her
the whole evening.	53.3959
All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over.	79.2507
Every idea that had been brought
forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as she
stood before the canvas, on which he was represented, and fixed his eyes
upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of
gratitude than it had ever raised before; she remembered its warmth, and
softened its impropriety of expression.	55.7203
All field sports were over.	66.3356
She looked forward to their entrance, as the point on which all
her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend.	43.2992
But I
cannot find out that Jane saw any thing of him in London.	23.2738
He made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone down
the dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often
walk to Meryton.	50.5416
"I should not mind any thing at all."	17.0765
I never
in my life saw any thing more elegant than their dresses.	68.1740
Calling back
the servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathless an
accent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and
mistress home, instantly.	83.7813
It cannot last long.	33.6712
"Nay, if you are so serious about it, I shall consider the matter as
absolutely settled.	45.2401
They will have nothing else to
do."	18.5017
"And what is your success?"	30.2023
I had no notion but he would go a shooting, or something or
other, and not disturb us with his company.	61.8590
He
must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found
her."	36.5437
They are descended on the maternal
side, from the same noble line; and, on the father's, from respectable,
honourable, and ancient, though untitled families.	95.1335
Mary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how.	70.8219
He protested that she should receive from him no mark of
affection whatever, on the occasion.	75.6818
Mrs. Gardiner abused her stupidity.	46.3926
But though
every thing seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to gratify him
by any sigh of repentance; and rather looked with wonder at her friend
that she could have so cheerful an air, with such a companion.	58.1222
They have
known her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love
her better.	91.3992
But think no more of the letter.	42.8955
A clear ten
thousand per annum.	102.5715
In no countenance was attentive
curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley's, in spite of the
smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its
objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions
to Mr. Darcy were by no means over.	59.5390
Jane shook her head.	12.9133
She immediately felt
that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her,
must be the work of her brother, and without looking farther, it was
satisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made
him think really ill of her.	66.6869
But such as they were, it may be well supposed how eagerly
she went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited.	60.6323
One seems so forlorn without them."	124.0096
As the day of his arrival drew near,

"I begin to be sorry that he comes at all," said Jane to her sister.	43.1510
Mr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of
Mr. Philips's house, and then made their bows, in spite of Miss Lydia's
pressing entreaties that they would come in, and even in spite of Mrs.
Philips' throwing up the parlour window, and loudly seconding the
invitation.	51.9099
Well, Monday morning came, and I was in
such a fuss!	49.8406
We _will_ know where
we have gone--we _will_ recollect what we have seen.	65.7144
As for
their mother, Mr. Collins's letter had done away much of her ill-will,
and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure, which
astonished her husband and daughters.	52.5444
"I should be sorry indeed, if it were.	30.0598
Their lodgings were not long a secret,
and at length they began to know the officers themselves.	65.5306
The next was in these words.	58.3198
In a softened tone she declared
herself not at all offended; but he continued to apologise for about a
quarter of an hour.	46.9464
so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all
the objections which had made him prevent his friend's marrying her
sister, and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case,
was almost incredible!	45.1483
I cannot quite agree with you _there_.	32.5022
"I mention it, because it is the living which I ought to have had.	38.7633
"Is he married or single?"	111.5609
The loss of her daughter made Mrs. Bennet very dull for several days.	51.0723
Mr.
Hurst had therefore nothing to do, but to stretch himself on one of the
sophas and go to sleep.	50.9765
END OF VOL.	91.4315
She is on her road somewhere, I dare say, and so passing through
Meryton, thought she might as well call on you.	58.3184
Elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in
attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion.	109.1174
Another intreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the
desired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of
attachment.	110.1329
"I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as
these."	44.7523
Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience
generally is.	165.9622
The families who had been in town for the winter came
back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose.	67.5349
He is now perhaps sorry for what he has done, and anxious to
re-establish a character.	48.7652
The day of his and Lydia's departure soon came, and Mrs. Bennet was
forced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by no means
entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle, was likely to
continue at least a twelvemonth.	64.2694
His sense of her inferiority--of
its being a degradation--of the family obstacles which judgment had
always opposed to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed
due to the consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to
recommend his suit.	81.1674
Adieu.	232.3211
How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?"	164.4432
"And have you answered the letter?"	75.7623
Then, perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, she added,
"Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw from it this useful
lesson; that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable--that one false
step involves her in endless ruin--that her reputation is no less
brittle than it is beautiful,--and that she cannot be too much guarded
in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex."	85.5926
She was disturbed by no
fear for her felicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct.	53.2581
"There
is nothing the matter with me.	21.8904
You have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer."	48.3247
Though Darcy could never receive _him_ at Pemberley, yet, for
Elizabeth's sake, he assisted him farther in his profession.	59.3907
Elizabeth's spirits were so high on the occasion, that though she did
not often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins, she could not help asking
him whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley's invitation, and if he
did, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening's
amusement; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no
scruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke
either from the Archbishop, or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to
dance.	41.9289
They shook hands with
great cordiality; and then till her sister came down, she had to listen
to all he had to say, of his own happiness, and of Jane's perfections;
and in spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed all his
expectations of felicity, to be rationally founded, because they had for
basis the excellent understanding, and super-excellent disposition of
Jane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and
himself.	72.8860
It is impossible for _me_ to
be impartial.	23.8312
Had she not seen him in
Derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there, with no
other view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial
to Jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming
there _with_ his friend's permission, or being bold enough to come
without it.	51.7509
We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.	52.0475
"At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted."	106.9466
But who was your mother?	62.7161
Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word.	35.2724
To complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr. Darcy
had voluntarily done for Lydia.	46.0132
I hate such false
friends.	104.6898
If he did
shrug his shoulders, it was not till Sir William was out of sight.	39.1992
Mr. Gardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to see their
father at home on the following day, which was Saturday.	35.8529
Have a little
compassion on my nerves.	80.1789
But I will not be alarmed though your sister _does_ play so well.	35.1230
Elizabeth's misery increased, at such unnecessary, such officious
attention!	72.4012
"But to expose
the former faults of any person, without knowing what their present
feelings were, seemed unjustifiable.	108.7464
Her understanding
excellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating.	63.6258
"_I_ never saw such a woman.	19.8524
"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four
thousand a year come into the neighbourhood."	31.1704
A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood,
since you went away.	36.1057
Jane was not happy.	29.1396
Elizabeth coloured, and said--"A little."	24.5081
Most earnestly did she then intreat him to lose no more time before he
wrote.	55.8259
1.E.6.	605.5445
"I am afraid you do not like your pen.	15.0430
"_My_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, Eliza," said
Charlotte.	106.4641
He smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be
said.	37.7538
"If my children are silly I must hope to be always sensible of it."	43.9991
"No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to
rain; and then you must stay all night."	40.6124
I
shall now know how to act.	30.2699
I am impatient to see him."	11.0100
The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most
convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted
thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt and
to a milliner's shop just over the way.	86.4555
Shall you like to have such a brother?"	78.7453
The picture gallery, and two or three of the principal bed-rooms, were
all that remained to be shewn.	58.8299
Her ease and good
spirits increased.	76.6559
He immediately offered to fetch her
others; all that his library afforded.	63.0843
We
shall be at Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say there will be some
balls, and I will take care to get good partners for them all."	35.1914
And so, you like this man's sisters too,
do you?	87.5719
But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I
will ever recede.	61.8126
"That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer."	35.7286
Could there be
finer symptoms?	67.6548
His appearance was
greatly in his favour; he had all the best part of beauty, a fine
countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address.	71.4361
She is
a very headstrong foolish girl, and does not know her own interest; but
I will _make_ her know it."	39.5877
I rather wished, than
     believed him to be sincere; but at any rate, was perfectly ready to
     accede to his proposal.	67.7485
You see how continually we are engaged there.	63.2617
But when Elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very likely,
even to Charlotte's wishes, to be the case; and after various
conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from
the difficulty of finding any thing to do, which was the more probable
from the time of year.	57.1362
There was one part
especially, the opening of it, which I should dread your having the
power of reading again.	64.6906
From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and
were indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went
along, and how often especially Miss De Bourgh drove by in her phaeton,
which he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened
almost every day.	50.4461
--and when she had
gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing any thing of the
last page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not
regard it, that she would never look in it again.	39.0998
She was not rendered
formidable by silence; but whatever she said, was spoken in so
authoritative a tone, as marked her self-importance, and brought Mr.
Wickham immediately to Elizabeth's mind; and from the observation of the
day altogether, she believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he had
represented.	63.9261
"It has been a very agreeable day," said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth.	26.6107
You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by

"I am afraid, Mr. Darcy," observed Miss Bingley, in a half whisper,
"that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine
eyes."	32.7226
They are destined for each other by the voice of
every member of their respective houses; and what is to divide them?	67.2881
said Elizabeth.	15.3852
I must beg to return to
the house."	23.0364
Lady Catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said
to Darcy,

"Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss, if she practised more, and
could have the advantage of a London master.	44.9992
Jane had been a week in town, without either seeing or
hearing from Caroline.	70.8187
"I cannot believe it.	8.8512
When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen,
they returned down stairs, and taking leave of the housekeeper, were
consigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall door.	51.9475
"I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the propriety of
his friend's inclination, or why, upon his own judgment alone, he was to
determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy."	51.7437
Have all her friends left her?"	75.2571
At night she opened her heart to Jane.	67.2421
His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely
looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention
of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien; and
the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after
his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year.	83.5720
where, where is my uncle?"	53.5632
"No, indeed, I did not.--I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine's
connections.	31.8189
It will save me a world of trouble
and economy.	59.0294
"Are you not diverted?"	113.0244
"True.	116.2700
Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent;
and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity.	53.4643
"Yours, &c."

As it happened that Elizabeth had _much_ rather not, she endeavoured in
her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind.	94.5140
He enquired in a friendly, though general way, after her family,
and looked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever
done.	42.4454
"I want to know," said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her
sister's, "what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham.	36.6967
"I am not afraid of you," said he, smilingly.	15.9432
"You must decide for yourself," said Elizabeth, "and if upon mature
deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is
more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you by
all means to refuse him."	53.2065
Their fortune on both
sides is splendid.	124.9216
Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern.	61.9118
The loo table, however, did not appear.	25.5186
I understand that Mr. Collins has made
you an offer of marriage.	43.3921
"And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry?	42.1505
Their mutual affection will steady them; and I flatter myself
they will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in
time make their past imprudence forgotten."	114.2021
Darcy professed a great
curiosity to see the view from the Mount, and Elizabeth silently
consented.	78.5327
Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was
the case, and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed
and rejoiced in his domestic comforts.	64.8350
Certain it is, that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I
was of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no
less certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done
any thing to deserve to lose it.	57.9600
Wickham will never marry a woman without some money.	51.9034
"Now I have got some news for you," said Lydia, as they sat down to
table.	27.3738
People do not die of little
trifling colds.	78.9683
She resolved to give her the information herself, and
therefore charged Mr. Collins when he returned to Longbourn to dinner,
to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family.	55.0417
"Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.	38.4847
but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley's chaise to go to Meryton;
and the Hursts have no horses to theirs."	46.9488
"Oh!	7.8559
His plan did not vary on seeing them.--Miss Bennet's lovely face
confirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what
was due to seniority; and for the first evening _she_ was his settled
choice.	86.8468
It was evident that she was
much better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had before any idea of;
it was evident that he was very much in love with her.	28.6683
"You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of
friendship and affection.	50.4653
Her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious.	37.4260
Mr. Gardiner
expressed a wish of going round the whole Park, but feared it might be
beyond a walk.	42.5472
He was
directly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing,
that he could imagine but two motives for their chusing to walk up and
down the room together, with either of which motives his joining them
would interfere.	89.5947
She is almost three and twenty!	53.9405
Console Lady Catherine as well as
     you can.	45.2994
Darcy smiled and said, "You are perfectly right.	38.2504
And for _this_ we are to be
thankful.	29.8440
They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to
have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as
possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your
life."	51.7340
They were in fact very fine ladies; not
deficient in good humour when they were pleased, nor in the power of
being agreeable where they chose it; but proud and conceited.	77.9164
Elizabeth felt Jane's
pleasure.	40.6135
To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted, than as
her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement.	84.2207
Next to
being married, a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then.	71.7558
Jane looked at her doubtingly.	47.5771
and so did Mrs.
Forster.	33.5176
But that is one great difference between
us.	56.3585
"If he wants our society, let
him seek it.	63.1966
Mrs. Bennet could not give her consent, or
speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings,
though she talked to Bingley of nothing else, for half an hour; and when
Mr. Bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly shewed
how really happy he was.	64.7824
I am not qualified to form one.	38.9212
When Mr. Bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual
philosophic composure.	32.8788
cried Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction.	21.9119
Oh, that I knew how it was!"	37.3065
After a short pause,
her companion added, "You are too generous to trifle with me.	37.8508
"My mother would have had no objection, but my father hates London."	38.6547
"There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those
two young men.	92.4322
But I
will not repine.	17.7416
She then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information
of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly,
and of their meaning to dine that day in Grosvenor street, where Mr.
Hurst had a house.	70.0670
Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a comfortable income, but not
such a one as will allow of frequent journeys--and I am persuaded my
friend would not call herself _near_ her family under less than _half_
the present distance."	86.7978
Not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their
visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he
turned to his daughter and said,

"Jane, I congratulate you.	49.6484
This will never do."	27.5464
"Upon my word!--Well, that was very decided indeed--that does seem as
if----but however, it may all come to nothing you know."	98.6275
Yes, I call it a _very_ easy distance."	37.3293
"_You_ observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure," said Miss Bingley; "and I am
inclined to think that you would not wish to see _your sister_ make such
an exhibition."	21.3239
Bingley, she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period
saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed.	78.2391
Mr. Bennet made no answer, and each of them, deep in thought, continued
silent till they reached the house.	38.1682
He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immoveable from
surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party,
and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least
of perfect civility.	70.9234
Unless the elder brother is
very sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds."	69.0670
I _must_ have employment and society.	56.3238
Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction
took place.	51.3767
This gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers, but
Mrs. Bennet, who quarrelled with no compliments, answered most readily,

"You are very kind, sir, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it may
prove so; for else they will be destitute enough.	58.0615
how I wanted you!"	35.3535
I speak
feelingly.	40.8817
When Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley
could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to
his sister.	31.6738
"You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your
refusal of my addresses is merely words of course.	49.4209
Let me do it without farther loss of time.	43.2144
She
certainly did not hate him.	21.9760
She felt it to be the
probable consequence of her allusions to Mr. Wickham, and rejoiced in
it.	28.7057
"Why did not you all learn?--You ought all to have learned.	49.1415
Having been
frequently in company with him since her return, agitation was pretty
well over; the agitations of former partiality entirely so.	97.3528
In his present
behaviour to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure,
for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which
had marked the early part of their acquaintance, could only serve, after
what had since passed, to provoke her.	63.9171
To Kitty, however, it does not
     seem so wholly unexpected.	32.9889
It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.	40.2596
Happy shall I be, when his stay at Netherfield is over!"	96.3389
And so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the house.	30.9099
Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my
positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for I
have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the
blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation.	121.5052
It is not quite a week since they left Brighton.	29.3301
"Yes," replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, "but _that_
was only when I first knew her, for it is many months since I have
considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance."	43.8455
"Oh!	7.8559
"Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over, I presume," said Miss
Bingley;--"and pray what is the result?"	49.1095
I
cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen, in the whole range of my
acquaintance, that are really accomplished."	54.4805
Mrs. Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as
soon as they were gone Mr. Collins began.	28.6601
"And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike
to him, without any reason.	64.2807
My resolution of
thanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect.	101.1051
This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and I
flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem.	44.2151
The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives with them.	62.8889
The compliment to herself and her sister, was not unfelt.	32.2221
my dear," said Maria quite shocked at the mistake, "it is not Lady
Catherine.	41.1946
She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of
bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away
without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation, than
the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance.	74.6767
Elizabeth tried to join in her father's pleasantry, but could only force
one most reluctant smile.	63.8243
"I admire the activity of your benevolence," observed Mary, "but every
impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion,
exertion should always be in proportion to what is required."	84.1035
And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded his speech,
which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room.--Many
stared.--Many smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr. Bennet
himself, while his wife seriously commended Mr. Collins for having
spoken so sensibly, and observed in a half-whisper to Lady Lucas, that
he was a remarkably clever, good kind of young man.	60.6488
my dear," cried his wife, "I cannot bear to hear that mentioned.	15.7854
CHAPTER V.


Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets
were particularly intimate.	136.1074
I should infinitely prefer a book."	77.0796
A house in town!	49.0136
"I did not think Caroline in spirits," were her words, "but she was very
glad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming
to London.	39.3264
and with the
knowledge of your ill opinion too!	53.4521
Mrs. Bennet's best
comfort was, that Mr. Bingley must be down again in the summer.	41.0904
so much the man of fashion!	49.7845
I know not what to think.	18.8812
"Oh yes!--They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were traced
almost to London, but not beyond; they are certainly not gone to
Scotland."	68.3725
"Do
you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on
them, as nonsense?	56.9829
Two obstacles of the
five being thus removed, Mrs. Bennet sat looking and winking at
Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time, without making any
impression on them.	92.2717
My feelings will not be
repressed.	20.6895
It is such a spur to one's genius, such an
opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind.	66.0127
But my feelings are not only cordial
towards _him_; they are even impartial towards Miss King.	55.9059
So, do not put yourself to
inconvenience."	53.6065
"Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement.	32.3395
He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention.	48.0096
CHAPTER XIV.	15.1432
But I knew not--I was afraid of doing too
much.	23.6512
The dinner too in its turn was highly admired; and
he begged to know to which of his fair cousins, the excellence of its
cookery was owing.	85.4322
What am I to do?"	56.9301
CHAPTER XVII.	15.1432
I hope she will turn out well."	35.6173
But no
such recollection befriended her.	65.9259
Mr. Darcy looked just as he had been
used to look in Hertfordshire, paid his compliments, with his usual
reserve, to Mrs. Collins; and whatever might be his feelings towards her
friend, met her with every appearance of composure.	46.3953
No one but Jane, she thought,
could flatter herself with such an expectation.	38.6607
He joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their
aunt's, where his regret and vexation, and the concern of every body was
well talked over.--To Elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged
that the necessity of his absence _had_ been self imposed.	55.1512
But Mr. Gardiner
     could not be seen, and Mr. Darcy found, on further enquiry, that
     your father was still with him, but would quit town the next
     morning.	32.1574
"I beg your pardon," replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer.	35.0166
"And this," cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room,
"is your opinion of me!	46.9060
When they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which Elizabeth
had already asked, were of course repeated by the others, and they soon
found that Jane had no intelligence to give.	43.8684
At that instant she felt,
that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends, for
moments of such painful confusion.	83.0079
But may we not
hope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks
forward, may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful
intercourse you have known as friends, will be renewed with yet greater
satisfaction as sisters?--Mr.	102.7217
How little did you
tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton!	45.0759
When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose,
the tables were broke up, the carriage was offered to Mrs. Collins,
gratefully accepted, and immediately ordered.	52.7776
Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he
would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections.	55.2241
Elizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time.	25.6985
"Indeed, Mama, you are mistaken," said Elizabeth, blushing for her
mother.	25.2361
It was not all settled before Monday: as soon
     as it was, the express was sent off to Longbourn.	32.7941
"Yes, she will remain there till Christmas."	33.3182
"But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any
consideration in the world," replied Darcy.	42.9193
Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her
mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad
day.	36.3815
"Oh, Jane,
take care."	38.4271
Charlotte had hardly time to answer, before they were joined by Kitty,
who came to tell the same news, and no sooner had they entered the
breakfast-room, where Mrs. Bennet was alone, than she likewise began on
the subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion, and entreating
her to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her
family.	40.7890
Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth
remained with no very cordial feelings towards him.	49.3903
"Oh, yes!	22.6496
The ladies were somewhat more
fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper
window, that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse.	74.9684
"Oh!	7.8559
Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.	165.6496
She blushed again and
again over the perverseness of the meeting.	44.6605
Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more
delight.	98.9283
The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister, will
prove what she felt.	34.8984
"All young ladies accomplished!	111.8457
When Mr. Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he
sent his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that as soon
as the ceremony was over, they should proceed to Longbourn.	38.6284
After sitting long enough to admire every
article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to the fender, to
give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in London,
Mr. Collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden, which was large
and well laid out, and to the cultivation of which he attended himself.	59.8316
"How can you be so silly," cried her mother, "as to think of such a
thing, in all this dirt!	31.7804
She is unfortunately of a sickly
constitution, which has prevented her making that progress in many
accomplishments, which she could not otherwise have failed of; as I am
informed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still
resides with them.	64.2072
And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven
o'clock.	74.2190
When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham's departure, she found little
other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment.	59.5003
Your mother
should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters."	62.6581
"And so ended his affection," said Elizabeth impatiently.	53.7444
_My_
affections and wishes are unchanged, but one word from you will silence
me on this subject for ever."	75.8736
To Catherine and Lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were in any
degree interesting.	169.1371
Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.	45.8686
"If you were aware," said Elizabeth, "of the very great disadvantage to
us all, which must arise from the public notice of Lydia's unguarded and
imprudent manner; nay, which has already arisen from it, I am sure you
would judge differently in the affair."	46.6288
They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.	79.7604
But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the
latter, depended on the will of the parents.	50.6753
If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should
     be almost tempted to say, that there is a strong appearance of
     duplicity in all this.	36.0785
We must have Mrs. Long and the Gouldings soon.	56.1741
Mr. Bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar.	67.0451
But amidst
     your concern for the defects of your nearest relations, and your
     displeasure at this representation of them, let it give you
     consolation to consider that, to have conducted yourselves so as to
     avoid any share of the like censure, is praise no less generally
     bestowed on you and your eldest sister, than it is honourable to
     the sense and disposition of both.--I will only say farther, that
     from what passed that evening, my opinion of all parties was
     confirmed, and every inducement heightened, which could have led me
     before, to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy
     connection.--He left Netherfield for London, on the day following,
     as you, I am certain, remember, with the design of soon
     returning.--The part which I acted, is now to be explained.--His
     sisters' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own; our
     coincidence of feeling was soon discovered; and, alike sensible
     that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother, we shortly
     resolved on joining him directly in London.--We accordingly
     went--and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to
     my friend, the certain evils of such a choice.--I described, and
     enforced them earnestly.--But, however this remonstrance might have
     staggered or delayed his determination, I do not suppose that it
     would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been
     seconded by the assurance which I hesitated not in giving, of your
     sister's indifference.	95.6541
"Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?"	64.2307
"You forget that I have made no
answer.	17.5428
"Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane's disposition as you do."	49.0365
Your alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned
by any of us."	76.4682
Well!	26.3789
"As much as I ever wish to be," cried Elizabeth warmly,--"I have spent
four days in the same house with him, and I think him very
disagreeable."	32.9473
Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth;
and Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather _knew_ that she was happy,
than _felt_ herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment,
there were other evils before her.	71.7588
Miss Bingley sees that her brother is
in love with you, and wants him to marry Miss Darcy.	27.4314
Nor was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at all
likely to make her more elegant.	56.0292
The discomposure of spirits, which this extraordinary visit threw
Elizabeth into, could not be easily overcome; nor could she for many
hours, learn to think of it less than incessantly.	109.6863
What shall we do with him?	28.5960
where is your sash my dear?"	52.0537
"I have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love," said Darcy.	31.4241
Let me mend it for you.	37.8738
To be
sure that _did_ seem as if he admired her--indeed I rather believe he
_did_--I heard something about it--but I hardly know what--something
about Mr.	71.3206
"I believe, Ma'am, I may safely promise you _never_ to dance with him."	31.4898
It was an
encouragement of vice; and had I been the rector of Longbourn, I should
very strenuously have opposed it.	51.4634
I was
     sometimes quite provoked, but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth
     and Jane, and for their sakes had patience with her.	60.2495
It was necessary to laugh, when she
would rather have cried.	35.4830
"What think you of _this_ sentence, my dear Lizzy?"	57.6979
His character
     was to speak for itself.	35.9039
"I must go instantly to my mother;" she cried.	32.8219
Have you not heard me say, that from his
earliest hours he was destined for his cousin?"	89.5646
"Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them
all."	40.8991
Well, now
let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way
home.	56.3663
"Oh!	7.8559
We have not met since the 26th of November, when
we were all dancing together at Netherfield."	58.5283
I have great hopes of finding him quite the
reverse.	66.3234
"You are all kindness, Madam; but I believe we must abide by our
original plan."	69.2515
It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he
had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended
him still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in
being with him, as well as by his evident admiration of her, of her
former favourite George Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw
there was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners,
she believed he might have the best informed mind.	57.1605
She felt that she had no business at
Pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it.	29.0970
His answer to this
sudden attack was delightful to their mother's ear.	142.6065
Mr. Collins was carefully instructing them in
what they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many
servants, and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them.	61.0811
This
however was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time
comfortably enough; there were half hours of pleasant conversation with
Charlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year, that she
had often great enjoyment out of doors.	67.8144
"How could
you begin?"	35.8031
He has heartily forgiven me
now."	108.2975
After waiting at home every morning
for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the
visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more,
the alteration of her manner, would allow Jane to deceive herself no
longer.	74.2222
"Yes, very indifferent indeed," said Elizabeth, laughingly.	26.4349
"I beg your pardon.	21.0016
"I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with
you as ever."	37.9111
Mr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister's proficiency.	47.1524
If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, Elizabeth's
change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty.	114.8274
"The person of whom I speak, is a gentleman and a stranger."	45.0195
She was convinced that
she could have been happy with him; when it was no longer likely they
should meet.	39.0335
You will be a very happy woman."	27.7038
It was consoling, that he should know she had
some relations for whom there was no need to blush.	56.4204
The church _ought_ to have been my profession--I
was brought up for the church, and I should at this time have been in
possession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we
were speaking of just now."	61.1562
In this manner Lady Catherine talked on, till they were at the door of
the carriage, when turning hastily round, she added,

"I take no leave of you, Miss Bennet.	41.5110
As yet, she
cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard, nor of its
reasonableness.	56.0565
The only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her,
and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he
told her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter.	58.6552
"But upon my honour I do _not_.	44.6841
"Oh!	7.8559
"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of."	44.8479
then--some time or other we shall be happy to hear you.	44.7623
They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk
that led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for
conversation with a woman, who was now more than usually insolent and
disagreeable.	83.5447
"I am astonished, my dear," said Mrs. Bennet, "that you should be so
ready to think your own children silly.	19.3612
People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints
can have no great inclination for talking.	144.3300
yes;--there is nothing in that.	22.9831
It was not known that Wickham had a single relation, with whom he kept
up any connection, and it was certain that he had no near one living.	47.0415
I told Mrs. Collins so before you came.	63.2216
Miss Darcy's praise occupied
the chief of it.	32.4387
or had you intended any more serious consequence?"	237.2504
It only shews her being
deficient in something herself--sense or feeling."	193.8980
This preservative she had now
obtained; and at the age of twenty-seven, without having ever been
handsome, she felt all the good luck of it.	78.0782
She was wild to be at home--to hear, to see, to be upon the spot, to
share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a
family so deranged; a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and
requiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing
could be done for Lydia, her uncle's interference seemed of the utmost
importance, and till he entered the room, the misery of her impatience
was severe.	58.8712
The subject elevated him
to more than usual solemnity of manner, and with a most important aspect
he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a
person of rank--such affability and condescension, as he had himself
experienced from Lady Catherine.	72.9144
They are in the same profession, you know; only in different
lines.	56.0434
"I hope not so.	45.5378
After this period, every
     appearance of acquaintance was dropt.	69.2389
I did not think Mrs.
Gardiner was so little to be trusted."	28.1308
She was even
sensible of some pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding how
steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and
confidence subsisted between Mr. Darcy and herself.	77.1424
"Good Heaven!	40.6780
"Wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we have thought him;" said her
sister.	38.4482
her liveliness had been never worse timed.	65.2922
Here are officers enough at
Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country.	49.3209
"Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks.	43.4900
Darcy?"	45.1040
"Or in other words, you are determined to have him.	39.9148
Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been
distinguished by his sisters.	22.0765
Elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the
visit.	64.8038
"No, I believe not."	29.9398
Jane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his
goodness.	33.2862
Oh,
Lord!	19.8226
Lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion
and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose
affection had brought her into public at an early age.	79.6244
If
he no longer cares for me, why silent?	83.9179
Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this was not
the best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always
wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the
success she expected.	90.6595
Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield
brought the following note for Elizabeth:

     "My dearest Lizzy,

     "I FIND myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to be
     imputed to my getting wet through yesterday.	87.3085
She was not sorry, however, to
have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from
whom they sprung.	39.1684
Mrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a
note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant waited
for an answer.	50.5046
"I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly
did.	43.5449
Pray write instantly, and let me understand it--unless it is,
for very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to
think necessary; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with
ignorance."	73.3601
"Oh!	7.8559
"The indirect boast;--for you are really proud of your defects in
writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of
thought and carelessness of execution, which if not estimable, you think
at least highly interesting.	90.0009
Every disposition of the ground was
good; and she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered
on its banks, and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace
it, with delight.	49.1565
But perhaps you have
been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person; in which case
you may be sure of my pardon."	41.2191
Such
doings discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly.	67.7191
One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a
fortnight.	40.1719
His most particular
friend, you see by Jane's account, was persuaded of his never intending
to marry her.	57.5905
This is the last time I shall ever
remember it myself."	39.7910
If he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he might
have obtained my affections and hand, I shall soon cease to regret him
at all."	49.2962
Will you do me the honour of reading that letter?"	64.2642
I shall
pull it to pieces as soon as I get home, and see if I can make it up any
better."	56.4318
Miss Darcy, though with a
diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations,
readily obeyed.	63.3286
In
terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother, though
expressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect
approbation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the
engagements that had been made for him.	65.9936
"It is unlucky," said she, after a short pause, "that you should not be
able to see your friends before they leave the country.	25.7996
She then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope of
being at home again in a day or two.	67.6231
What could your ladyship propose by it?"	68.4858
"Oh!	7.8559
When first he came in, he had spoken to her but little;
but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention.	89.4834
for you are a young lady of deep reflection I know, and read great
books, and make extracts."	65.7049
CHAPTER XV.	15.1432
Till Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield and looked in
vain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a
doubt of his being present had never occurred to her.	58.6549
He is come--Mr. Bingley is
come.--He is, indeed.	55.6800
You have done all this!	31.4707
There are few people
whom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well.	76.3248
Her sister, however, assured her, of her being perfectly well; and their
conversation, which had been passing while Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were
engaged with their children, was now put an end to, by the approach of
the whole party.	39.9163
It would have spared her from
explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give;
but they were now necessary, and she assured him with some confusion, of
her attachment to Mr. Darcy.	42.3374
It is a great comfort to have you
     so rich, and when you have nothing else to do, I hope you will
     think of us.	29.0534
"You cannot be too much on your guard.	13.1930
I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady
and regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it.	79.7106
Our
instrument is a capital one, probably superior to----You shall try it
some day.--Do your sisters play and sing?"	115.5453
Then, after a short silence, he continued, "Lizzy, I bear you no
ill-will for being justified in your advice to me last May, which,
considering the event, shews some greatness of mind."	81.6525
I thought it my duty
to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she and
her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run
hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned."	77.1260
"She will drop the acquaintance entirely."	59.5031
But
Lizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me.	38.2099
He now wished it more than ever.	47.8936
Then turning to Mr. Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist at
backgammon.	89.3463
On distinguishing the ladies of the group,
the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and began the usual
civilities.	69.7272
She would be in nobody's way, you know, in that
part of the house."	27.3686
Everything wore
a happier aspect.	167.6592
I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have
supposed about Mr. Bingley.	32.0059
And so, Darcy did every thing;
made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow's debts, and got him
his commission!	73.1570
Till I
can forget his father, I can never defy or expose _him_."	73.5228
1.C.	563.5114
Elizabeth had received none since her return, that could come from
Pemberley.	59.2716
Miss Bennet still looked all amazement.	47.6305
"That is the most unforgiving speech," said Elizabeth, "that I ever
heard you utter.	35.2172
"I advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty," said Mrs. Bennet, "to walk
to Oakham Mount this morning.	39.5538
Miss Bingley I am sure cannot.	24.7350
She was sure they should be married some time or
     other, and it did not much signify when.	42.4745
I will speak to her about it myself directly.	64.1490
Your tempers are by no means unlike.	67.1320
I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a
     clergyman.	24.8972
Pray read on."	109.1863
Why, he has four or five thousand a-year, and very likely
more."	74.8415
Let them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied."	68.2220
I want to talk very seriously.	38.4460
"How can you talk so?"	30.9270
"I certainly have not the talent which some people possess," said Darcy,
"of conversing easily with those I have never seen before.	87.0797
He
comes down on Thursday at the latest, very likely on Wednesday.	76.9817
It was a
comfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been wearied
by long expectations.	50.9545
Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.	143.3143
"I admire all my three sons-in-law highly," said he.	70.7936
The supposition did not pain her.	53.0530
He sat down for a few moments, and
then getting up walked about the room.	32.6204
He must write his own sermons; and the time
that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care
and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making
as comfortable as possible.	47.2565
Mr. Philips
visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity
unknown before.	92.0759
As all
conversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the
room.	46.6385
How far your nephew might approve of your interference in _his_ affairs,
I cannot tell; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in
mine.	59.7603
Mrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied; and quitted the house under the
delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of
settlements, new carriages and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly
see her daughter settled at Netherfield, in the course of three or four
months.	74.4243
Follies
and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies _do_ divert me, I own, and I
laugh at them whenever I can.--But these, I suppose, are precisely what
you are without."	92.2263
She
looked at Jane, and smiled, and shook her head by turns.	21.5770
Even Elizabeth began to fear--not that Bingley was indifferent--but that
his sisters would be successful in keeping him away.	78.2414
I dare say he often hears worse
things said than I am going to say.	48.9546
In a short time, I shall have a daughter married.	28.6338
"Miss Bennet," replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, "you ought to
know, that I am not to be trifled with.	23.4965
But I believe your opinion of him would in general
astonish--and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly
anywhere else.--Here you are in your own family."	68.2209
And we all know that Wickham has every charm of
person and address that can captivate a woman."	80.1103
She then took a large house in Edward-street,
     and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings.	65.8629
But you have chosen your fault well.--I
really cannot _laugh_ at it.	53.6474
The
acknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the unacknowledged were silent.	103.0814
A lively imagination soon settled it all.	83.2851
[Illustration: Morning Dress.	298.4411
Mr. Denny addressed them directly, and entreated permission to
introduce his friend, Mr. Wickham, who had returned with him the day
before from town, and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in
their corps.	58.2864
"For we must attribute this happy conclusion," she added, "in a great
measure, to his kindness.	47.9974
Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to, it was not on her side a
_scheme_ of infamy.	71.4317
There
could not exist in the world _two_ men, over whom Mr. Darcy could have
such boundless influence.	94.5634
Mrs. Bennet, accompanied by her
two youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.	80.1625
The younger girls formed hopes
of _coming out_ a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have
done; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte's
dying an old maid.	105.3192
You must therefore allow me to follow the dictates
of my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to perform what I look
on as a point of duty.	74.8719
"But,"
she continued, recollecting herself, "as we know none of the
particulars, it is not fair to condemn him.	38.5765
As
soon as they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called on by her
cousin, to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings, which,
for Charlotte's sake, she made more favourable than it really was.	35.7280
But I will endeavour to banish every painful
     thought, and think only of what will make me happy, your affection,
     and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt.	48.7734
"I can easily believe it.	14.9860
"But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be
required.	47.9909
Thursday was to be the wedding day,
and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit; and when she rose
to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of her mother's ungracious and
reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself, accompanied her
out of the room.	55.8915
"No--I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did."	37.5976
When Mr.
Collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed,
which certainly was not unseldom, she involuntarily turned her eye on
Charlotte.	62.2327
"It must not be thought of.	43.0317
Mr. Bennet's property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two
thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed in
default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother's
fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply
the deficiency of his.	81.6394
"We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side," said
Jane: "I hope and trust they will yet be happy.	64.5312
I assure you, that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it."	20.5986
"My fingers," said Elizabeth, "do not move over this instrument in the
masterly manner which I see so many women's do.	73.0496
For
     about three years I heard little of him; but on the decease of the
     incumbent of the living which had been designed for him, he applied
     to me again by letter for the presentation.	64.4831
Yes, Miss
Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or
friends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all.	49.6504
He was too happy, however, to need much attention;
and luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them
from a great deal of his company.	38.7457
"Indeed I do not dare."	27.4434
Mr. Collins readily assented,
and a book was produced; but on beholding it, (for every thing announced
it to be from a circulating library,) he started back, and begging
pardon, protested that he never read novels.--Kitty stared at him, and
Lydia exclaimed.--Other books were produced, and after some deliberation
he chose Fordyce's Sermons.	83.7374
He came, and in such very good time, that the ladies were none of them
dressed.	38.7062
The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters
and of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss
Darcy and the amusements of London, might be too much, she feared, for
the strength of his attachment.	53.6847
Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the
society of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and
Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr.
Wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in Mr. Darcy's
looks and behaviour.	42.5073
Mr. Wickham's happiness and her own was per force
delayed a little longer, and Mr. Collins's proposal accepted with as
good a grace as she could.	60.2509
Every body declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world;
and every body began to find out, that they had always distrusted the
appearance of his goodness.	34.9415
Mr. Darcy felt their rudeness
and immediately said,--

"This walk is not wide enough for our party.	90.8444
can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.	114.7489
"I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?"	26.9507
_Your_
retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment
arising from them, is not of philosophy, but what is much better, of
ignorance.	89.6260
While Sir William was with them, Mr. Collins devoted his mornings
to driving him out in his gig, and shewing him the country; but when he
went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments, and
Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin
by the alteration, for the chief of the time between breakfast and
dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden, or in reading
and writing, and looking out of window in his own book room, which
fronted the road.	51.8564
"A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant
decorums which other people may observe.	140.4921
When Lydia went away, she promised to write very often and very minutely
to her mother and Kitty; but her letters were always long expected, and
always very short.	77.3587
He only meant that there were not
such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town, which
you must acknowledge to be true."	33.5092
I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy."	31.8235
His circumstances, he
     assured me, and I had no difficulty in believing it, were
     exceedingly bad.	41.4651
They found Mr. Bennet still up.	59.1786
Robinson."	104.1897
Elizabeth took the letter from his writing table, and they went up
stairs together.	27.0612
Again she read on.	87.0211
All that is known after this is, that they were seen
     to continue the London road.	72.4131
"Good God!	54.3187
While these
newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of
Elizabeth's feelings was every moment increasing.	90.2683
I am very glad
you liked her.	16.8578
"But you see that Jane," said her aunt, "does not think so ill of
Wickham, as to believe him capable of the attempt."	26.2957
I have not forgot, you see; and I assure
you, I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep
your engagement."	34.5493
She
wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing
which she could not praise.	65.7080
To be sure, you knew no actual good of me--but nobody thinks
of _that_ when they fall in love."	56.9589
Where shall you change
horses?--Oh!	94.8888
Mr. Bennet protested against any
description of finery.	58.4801
Here again I shall give you pain--to what degree you only can tell.	90.7251
She was no sooner in possession of it, than
hurrying into the little copse, where she was least likely to be
interrupted, she sat down on one of the benches, and prepared to be
happy; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not
contain a denial.	32.7277
I believe I have now told you every thing.	26.2539
_Her_ mind
was less difficult to develope.	64.4060
said Elizabeth, still
addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam.	29.7371
"Oh!	7.8559
CHAPTER X.	15.1432
"No, I should have turned in a moment."	27.4148
Elizabeth's collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and
as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to
Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able
to speak any more.	72.7307
The expression
of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and
steady gravity.	133.2884
CHAPTER II.	15.1432
They were able to love each
other, even as well as they intended.	32.8389
I do not at
     all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me, but
     if the same circumstances were to happen again, I am sure I should
     be deceived again.	29.6932
"How strange!"	25.7896
Its completion depended on others.	210.4812
Elizabeth listened with
delight to the happy, though modest hopes which Jane entertained of
Bingley's regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence
in it.	44.6767
It had always been evident to her that such an
income as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in
their wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to
their support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either Jane or
herself were sure of being applied to, for some little assistance
towards discharging their bills.	92.4718
They stood a little
aloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused,
scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer she
returned to his civil enquiries after her family.	67.2236
"I am sick of Mr. Bingley," cried his wife.	15.7011
"You must not blame my aunt.	22.2370
The comfort to _her_,
of the regiment's approaching removal, was indeed beyond expression.	92.1995
"Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such
insensibility."	54.8541
"Yes; but when questioned by _him_ Denny denied knowing any thing of
their plan, and would not give his real opinion about it.	55.3443
Colonel Fitzwilliam,
who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and
address most truly the gentleman.	77.0956
who could have done less for her?	61.9987
It was hardly enough; but it pleased her.	55.9722
"The conduct of neither, if strictly examined,
will be irreproachable; but since then, we have both, I hope, improved
in civility."	82.3443
She looked at Jane, to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly
talking to Bingley.	39.8018
Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought
to do?"	32.7351
It is useless to talk of it."	14.2858
To my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle
away like other young men."	54.3960
Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.	252.0759
"And this is your real opinion!	49.2806
They were
rather handsome, had been educated in one of the first private
seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds, were in the
habit of spending more than they ought, and of associating with people
of rank; and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of
themselves, and meanly of others.	60.6367
"Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both
like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect to any other
leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded."	69.1651
They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and,
while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehensions of
meeting its owner returned.	65.1714
She has a very good notion
of fingering, though her taste is not equal to Anne's.	54.5794
"It is from Miss Bingley," said Jane, and then read it aloud.	23.0843
He is perfectly amiable.	18.7188
Her hopes were answered; Jane had not been gone long before it
rained hard.	93.3280
But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom
they had never seen before, of most gentleman-like appearance, walking
with an officer on the other side of the way.	42.2282
You have shewn him off now much
more than he did himself."	50.1525
"Yes; where else can they be so well concealed?"	142.4232
--said Jane faintly smiling,--"You must know that
though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I could
not hesitate."	48.4404
For the truth of every thing here related, I can appeal more
     particularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam, who from our
     near relationship and constant intimacy, and still more as one of
     the executors of my father's will, has been unavoidably acquainted
     with every particular of these transactions.	70.9698
"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken
by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came
down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much
delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is
to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be
in the house by the end of next week."	62.8306
Mr. what's his name.	150.3526
How any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from
one's own daughters I cannot understand; and all for the sake of Mr.
Collins too!--Why should _he_ have it more than anybody else?"	83.7062
"What, is he coming home, and without poor Lydia!"	141.1593
Could he expect that her friends
would not step forward?	70.9737
Elizabeth related to Jane the next day, what had passed between Mr.
Wickham and herself.	30.7661
There could be no conversation in the noise of
Mrs. Philips's supper party, but his manners recommended him to every
body.	43.1754
the story which followed of his designs on Miss Darcy,
received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel
Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she was
referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam
himself--from whom she had previously received the information of his
near concern in all his cousin's affairs, and whose character she had no
reason to question.	61.4508
Other schemes too came into her head.	173.2540
Mrs. Gardiner had seen Pemberley, and known the late Mr. Darcy by
character perfectly well.	63.2390
"Lizzy," said her father, "I have given him my consent.	19.1712
They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and
every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer
reach of the woods to which they were approaching; but it was some time
before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered
mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and seemed
to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she
distinguished no part of the scene.	63.6396
If I could but see _you_ as happy!	65.9897
Poor Reynolds, she was always very fond of
me.	46.7800
Have you had any
flirting?	82.7036
The least agreeable
circumstance in the business, was the surprise it must occasion to
Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other
person.	68.1222
Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory.	83.7441
"Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent," said she,
"did he come at all?"	38.7498
"Yes, all of them, I think.	28.5482
Elizabeth shook her head over this letter.	22.4886
Well, and so just
as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away upon business
to that horrid man Mr. Stone.	108.6484
In that
county, there was enough to be seen, to occupy the chief of their three
weeks; and to Mrs. Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction.	74.9518
how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation
she had ever encouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed
towards him.	114.1445
Only think what a miserable summer else we shall
have!"	165.9403
That tall, proud man."	108.3712
Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.	122.5265
You must write again very
     soon, and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last.	30.7949
that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance!"	42.8784
But though Bingley and Jane
meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and as they
always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that
every moment should be employed in conversing together.	98.4602
I have therefore made up my mind to tell
you, that I do not want to dance a reel at all--and now despise me if
you dare."	55.9063
Lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him how
much he will give her.	27.8217
"Your friend performs delightfully;" he
continued after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group;--"and I doubt
not that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr.	97.6834
Sir William could not have
interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for
themselves.--We have tried two or three subjects already without
success, and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine."	56.8640
One morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two
elder sisters, she said to Elizabeth,

"Lizzy, I never gave _you_ an account of my wedding, I believe.	42.2219
He seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking up
and down the room in earnest meditation; his brow contracted, his air
gloomy.	76.1961
Anne would have
been a delightful performer, had her health allowed her to learn."	72.8462
"Then, who taught you?	56.6601
Wickham passed all his youth there, you
know."	50.6643
They were hopeless of remedy.	40.9546
Mr. Collins, however, was not
discouraged from speaking again, and Mr. Darcy's contempt seemed
abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech, and at the
end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way.	41.6160
I
     must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget
     myself, and which no obligation less than the present should induce
     me to unfold to any human being.	73.5493
She replied in the affirmative.	27.7029
Your mother insists upon your
accepting it.	133.4266
yes--the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so
accomplished!--She plays and sings all day long.	104.2487
"The country," said Darcy, "can in general supply but few subjects for
such a study.	68.6319
Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter
and fainter; and in farther justification of Mr. Darcy, she could not
but allow that Mr. Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago
asserted his blamelessness in the affair; that proud and repulsive as
were his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their
acquaintance, an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much
together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways, seen any thing
that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust--any thing that spoke him
of irreligious or immoral habits.	80.1994
And when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect
unconcern, "Oh!	46.5474
He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday, to say
that he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which I
particularly begged him to do.	51.4190
You take
delight in vexing me.	65.0541
It was
necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on
such occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs.
Bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life.	64.7691
She then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had
intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his daughter.	40.9345
She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother's being an
inmate of Mr. Darcy's house, and mentioned with raptures, some plans of
the latter with regard to new furniture.	47.4003
was a wonder which
introduced the discussion of _their_ affairs.	68.7382
The power of doing any thing with
quickness is always much prized by the possessor, and often without any
attention to the imperfection of the performance.	63.9178
"So, Lizzy," said he one day,
"your sister is crossed in love I find.	67.9141
"How very ill Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy," she cried; "I
never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter.	63.9907
Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her
feelings appear what they were not.	38.2842
But I confess they would have no charms
for _me_.	26.5028
Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming, without changing
colour.	25.1583
Many circumstances might make it
     more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to
     pursue their first plan; and even if _he_ could form such a design
     against a young woman of Lydia's connections, which is not likely,
     can I suppose her so lost to every thing?--Impossible.	79.2312
While in their cradles, we planned
the union: and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would
be accomplished, in their marriage, to be prevented by a young woman of
inferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to
the family!	60.8853
That his two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should
have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough, and
she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman, or
the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.	48.3031
When first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly
useless; for, of course, they were to have a son.	48.2269
She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his
being partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs.
Collins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of
raising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her
opinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend's dislike would
vanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power.	67.2245
"Oh, yes!--that, that is the worst of all.	30.7482
"And if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by you, and
admire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady once did.	46.0960
The two girls had been whispering to
each other during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that the
youngest should tax Mr. Bingley with having promised on his first coming
into the country to give a ball at Netherfield.	54.5683
"Ten thousand pounds!	26.2597
Are not you
curious to hear how it was managed?"	50.5165
"Your great men often are; and therefore I shall not take him
at his word about fishing, as he might change his mind another day, and
warn me off his grounds."	93.5269
Lizzy, to
know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear
family!	44.6337
The feelings which, you tell me, have long prevented the
acknowledgment of your regard, can have little difficulty in overcoming
it after this explanation."	72.7709
"Well," cried her mother, "it is all very right; who should do it but
her own uncle?	44.6696
At five o'clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half past six
Elizabeth was summoned to dinner.	87.5607
Though suspicion was very far
from Miss Bennet's general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here.	53.5657
"I will not be interrupted.	12.3681
As for myself, it is many, many years since I first began to think
     of him in a very different manner.	65.4878
"As I did the other day," said Elizabeth, with a conscious smile; "very
true, it will be wise in me to refrain from _that_.	56.6976
Mrs. Bennet was not in the
habit of walking, Mary could never spare time, but the remaining five
set off together.	43.0463
These parties were acceptable to
all; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did
think, than such as did not.	96.0158
"You expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine, but
which I have never acknowledged.	69.3884
We had better go into the
avenue."	34.2796
But I was not then
     master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed.	57.8621
But
her commendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means
satisfy Mr. Collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her Ladyship's
praise into his own hands.	56.7867
You are
each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so
easy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will
always exceed your income."	68.2605
The children have been wanting me this half hour.	79.6994
At least, you should not _remind_ your Mother of inviting him."	51.8916
When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in
her praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her sister how very much
she admired him.	58.0653
Every kind of pride must revolt from the
connection.	76.5738
Jane listened with astonishment and concern;--she
knew not how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr.
Bingley's regard; and yet, it was not in her nature to question the
veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham.--The
possibility of his having really endured such unkindness, was enough to
interest all her tender feelings; and nothing therefore remained to be
done, but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each, and
throw into the account of accident or mistake, whatever could not be
otherwise explained.	55.8326
The officer was the very
Mr. Denny, concerning whose return from London Lydia came to inquire,
and he bowed as they passed.	84.6388
"It ought to be good," he replied, "it has been the work of many
generations."	32.7780
"This will not do," said Elizabeth.	23.4181
You and the girls may go, or you may send
them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are
as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the
party."	48.4756
And his behaviour, so
strikingly altered,--what could it mean?	53.0516
The reason why all this was to be done by him
     alone, was such as I have given above.	78.2384
The Miss
Webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as
your's.--Do you draw?"	114.3669
"And what is fifty miles of good road?	101.7011
Tell her that you insist upon her
marrying him."	41.7424
She was ashamed to think how
much.	23.6075
She talked to Elizabeth again and again;
coaxed and threatened her by turns.	74.0465
"She did not choose it," said her daughter, "she would go."	20.4771
"I will not trust myself on the subject," replied Wickham, "_I_ can
hardly be just to him."	21.6749
CHAPTER XII.	15.1432
is she handsome?"	50.7449
But however he did not.	23.7019
"And can you likewise declare, that there is no _foundation_ for it?"	49.0532
"My dear, dear
aunt," she rapturously cried, "what delight!	40.8819
"That is as it happens.	27.0267
"When _my_ eyes were opened to his real character.--Oh!	47.9877
But they did pass away, and Mr. and
Mrs. Gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at
Longbourn.	61.5860
It had better have happened to _you_, Lizzy; you
would have laughed yourself out of it sooner.	52.9724
Elizabeth was forced to go.	14.2348
"And will you promise me, never to enter into such an engagement?"	94.1300
"What could he mean?	31.7595
He does not
want abilities.	29.7365
"Aye, so it is," cried her mother, "and Mrs. Long does not come back
till the day before; so, it will be impossible for her to introduce him,
for she will not know him herself."	37.0604
Mrs. Long said so too, for I asked her whether you did not.	63.7513
"We have not quite determined how far it shall carry us," said Mrs.
Gardiner, "but perhaps to the Lakes."	43.6133
She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of
their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance.	75.7703
I pity, though I
     cannot help blaming her.	20.5028
"Gracechurch-street, Sept. 6.	196.8868
Darcy had walked away to another part of the room.	20.2431
"Well, mamma," said she, when they were all returned to the breakfast
room, "and what do you think of my husband?	21.0108
What did Colonel
Forster say?	38.4524
which will not be yours till after your mother's
decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to.	59.6812
But, luckily, he came back
again in ten minutes time, and then we all set out.	77.6267
The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield.	88.3636
How I long to see her!	50.1709
She now lost every expectation of pleasure.	32.2049
"Blame you!	50.6469
"But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow.	58.4002
He is rich, to be
sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane.	49.1754
In nine cases out of ten, a woman had better shew _more_
affection than she feels.	62.2037
He repeated the question, with some
surprise at her silence.	70.7892
Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to Jane,
while Mrs. Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village,
when she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of a
visitor.	57.4615
"Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?"	69.4516
Wretched, wretched, mistake!"	92.7509
Mr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his
successful love; for Mrs. Bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule
to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw Elizabeth open the
door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she
entered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself in
warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection.	67.6901
But
     it was two or three days before he could get from her what he
     wanted.	53.8210
She performed her part
indeed without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied, and
soon afterwards ordered her carriage.	66.4909
They have some of the finest woods in the
country."	33.6650
the eldest Miss Bennet
beyond a doubt, there cannot be two opinions on that point."	44.2713
Jane was as much gratified by this, as her
mother could be, though in a quieter way.	37.0278
I wonder what he can be doing there."	36.3786
Her younger
sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness
which she might in future be able to dispense.	70.5694
"What, has she frightened away
some of your lovers?	161.1740
She had very little notice from any but him.	47.6751
My father was not
     only fond of this young man's society, whose manners were always
     engaging; he had also the highest opinion of him, and hoping the
     church would be his profession, intended to provide for him in it.	49.7188
My child, let me not have the grief of seeing
_you_ unable to respect your partner in life.	48.5851
They gradually ascended for
half a mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable
eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by
Pemberley House, situated on the opposite side of a valley, into which
the road with some abruptness wound.	89.6685
"I do not know when I have been more shocked," said she.	17.4911
"I am sure," she added, "if it was not for such good friends I do not
know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a
vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is
always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest
temper I ever met with.	47.9165
"He is a sweet tempered, amiable, charming man.	45.6638
Elizabeth, though she did not credit above
half of what was said, believed enough to make her former assurance of
her sister's ruin still more certain; and even Jane, who believed still
less of it, became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now
come, when if they had gone to Scotland, which she had never before
entirely despaired of, they must in all probability have gained some
news of them.	80.5589
As it was certain, however, that
somebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid
the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the
shrubbery.	54.8617
She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia, with
anxious parade, walk up to her mother's right hand, and hear her say to
her eldest sister, "Ah!	49.8976
Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed
the bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner,
who was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only of
returning to the carriage as quickly as possible.	47.4389
she was dying to know what could
be his meaning"--and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand
him?	47.1681
CHAPTER VII.	15.1432
My aunt Philips came to Longbourn
on Tuesday, after my father went away; and was so good as to stay till
Thursday with me.	44.1867
replied Kitty, "it looks just like that man that used to be with
him before.	80.1502
The carriage was sent to meet
them at ----, and they were to return in it, by dinner-time.	53.6738
I happened to overhear the
gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of
this house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of her mother
Lady Catherine.	51.4793
Much as I abominate
writing, I would not give up Mr. Collins's correspondence for any
consideration.	62.0721
After a few minutes reflection, however, she continued, "I _do_ remember
his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability of his
resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper.	51.3052
It was a painful, but
not an improbable, conjecture.	88.4911
Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what
she had heard, and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it,
when Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter to
announce her engagement to the family.	54.3966
"But," he added, "you will of course wish to have your humble respects
delivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you
while you have been here."	67.2772
I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just
said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long."	63.0234
Here, Sarah, come to Miss
Bennet this moment, and help her on with her gown.	66.9405
"Sure he
will not leave London before he has found them.	47.2447
The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be
requited.	26.9402
"Nothing child, nothing.	66.8945
CHAPTER VIII.	15.1432
"I can comprehend your going on charmingly, when
you had once made a beginning; but what could set you off in the first
place?"	81.7242
CHAPTER III.	15.1432
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.	81.3002
You ought certainly to forgive them as
a christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their names
to be mentioned in your hearing."	69.4210
"You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?"	49.4008
On entering the room, he seemed to
hesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was
decided.	57.9723
"Did it," said he, "did it _soon_ make you
think better of me?	41.7134
"I like her appearance," said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas.	33.5146
--

"My dear Madam," replied he, "let us be for ever silent on this point.	20.4123
"His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same," said
Elizabeth angrily; "for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse
than of being the son of Mr. Darcy's steward, and of _that_, I can
assure you, he informed me himself."	56.7654
Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.	98.1814
"MY DEAR BROTHER,

     "At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and such
     as, upon the whole, I hope will give you satisfaction.	35.1076
such an openness and gentleness in his manner."	93.7382
But it is of small importance."	39.1256
Elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant
a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by
mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself; and
endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters,
by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William, in which she
was readily joined by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the
happiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character
of Mr. Collins, and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London.	61.4867
Mr. Wickham, after a few moments,
touched his hat--a salutation which Mr. Darcy just deigned to return.	53.8807
I am so happy.	10.6595
But I know the
foundation is unjust.	40.8074
"He is the best landlord, and the best master," said she, "that ever
lived.	23.6810
They soon outstripped the others, and when they had
reached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were half a quarter of a
mile behind.	44.2270
But I can guess how it was;
every body says that he is ate up with pride, and I dare say he had
heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage, and had come to
the ball in a hack chaise."	52.4880
Her heart was divided between concern
for her sister, and resentment against all the others.	46.3764
"Very true, indeed;--and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to say in
behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the
business?--Do clear _them_ too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of
somebody."	54.6488
"It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come since you will not
visit them."	67.1202
Who
are your uncles and aunts?	124.4159
The two ladies were delighted to see
their dear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and
repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their
separation.	75.9174
To congratulate myself on the hope of relations, whose condition in life
is so decidedly beneath my own?"	66.4398
Has he deigned to add ought of civility to his
ordinary style?	164.7835
who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that
so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind, as was here
collected in one individual.	77.7740
Charlotte's reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth.	34.7976
She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of
Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked.	46.9691
After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm by a
lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing near
Elizabeth, said to her--

"Do not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such an
opportunity of dancing a reel?"	96.4227
she cried.	17.8823
"I have no reason, I assure you," said he, "to be dissatisfied with my
reception.	17.2234
Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections?	32.7707
My mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole house in
such confusion!"	45.3351
All the world are good and agreeable
in your eyes.	88.1565
"Kitty has no discretion in her coughs," said her father; "she times
them ill."

"I do not cough for my own amusement," replied Kitty fretfully.	62.7062
But there was still something lurking behind,
of which prudence forbad the disclosure.	86.8493
And who knows what _may_ happen?	73.0374
But I am at his disposal.	30.8479
All this was acknowledged to Mrs. Gardiner; and after relating the
circumstances, she thus went on:--"I am now convinced, my dear aunt,
that I have never been much in love; for had I really experienced that
pure and elevating passion, I should at present detest his very name,
and wish him all manner of evil.	60.9835
He never
said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of
listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre
that he was asking some odd unconnected questions--about her pleasure in
being at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her opinion of Mr.
and Mrs. Collins's happiness; and that in speaking of Rosings and her
not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to expect that whenever
she came into Kent again she would be staying _there_ too.	74.0110
Elizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her, and she felt how
little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them.	51.0194
A most welcome negative followed the last question--and her
alarms being now removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of
curiosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the
next morning, and she was again applied to, could readily answer, and
with a proper air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike
to the scheme.	44.2353
"No, that I am sure I shall not; and I think it was very impertinent of
him to write to you at all, and very hypocritical.	36.0846
Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained
quietly in the hall, till she and Kitty were out of sight, then returned
into the drawing-room.	41.9881
Proud that in a cause of compassion and honour, he had been able to get
the better of himself.	38.0053
To the little town of Lambton, the scene of Mrs. Gardiner's
former residence, and where she had lately learned that some
acquaintance still remained, they bent their steps, after having seen
all the principal wonders of the country; and within five miles of
Lambton, Elizabeth found from her aunt, that Pemberley was situated.	74.1180
"But why all this secrecy?	135.4755
In vain did she entreat him to stand up with
somebody else, and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room.	43.5844
Mrs.
Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage
before Tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if Mr. Bingley
and his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them very
well.--Against staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positively
resolved--nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the
contrary, as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long,
she urged Jane to borrow Mr. Bingley's carriage immediately, and at
length it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield
that morning should be mentioned, and the request made.	76.8680
"Not so hasty, if you please.	45.8771
I hoped to find you
reasonable; but depend upon it I will carry my point."	62.8623
"I have not the pleasure of understanding you," said he, when she had
finished her speech.	30.1155
"No, no, nonsense, Lizzy.--I desire you will stay where you are."	64.0395
Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.	70.8989
I was never more annoyed!	92.1725
They had not long separated when Miss Bingley came towards her, and with
an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her,

"So, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George
Wickham!--Your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a
thousand questions; and I find that the young man forgot to tell you,
among his other communications, that he was the son of old Wickham, the
late Mr. Darcy's steward.	56.7780
"In the first place," replied Mr. Gardiner, "there is no absolute proof
that they are not gone to Scotland."	24.4238
"I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which
laid the foundation.	41.4356
Oh!	7.8559
_Their_ situation was awkward enough; but _her's_ she
thought was still worse.	93.4223
Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far;
and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added,
"I have never had a cross word from him in my life, and I have known him
ever since he was four years old."	59.9129
_that_ abominable Mr.	65.4835
Things are settled so
oddly."	103.1435
Our poor mother
     is sadly grieved.	95.7559
Elizabeth's mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, after
half an hour's quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to join
the others with tolerable composure.	49.2224
Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile.	44.5627
I knew enough of your disposition to be certain, that,
had you been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you would have
acknowledged it to Lady Catherine, frankly and openly."	58.3650
It was not
in her nature, however, to increase her vexations, by dwelling on them.	32.9552
Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and
that she could not leave her.	28.9698
Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty followed, but
Lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could; and Charlotte,
detained first by the civility of Mr. Collins, whose inquiries after
herself and all her family were very minute, and then by a little
curiosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending
not to hear.	78.2415
You will not be fit to be seen when you get
there."	43.2994
My temper I dare not vouch
for.--It is I believe too little yielding--certainly too little for the
convenience of the world.	55.5897
I have been meditating on the very great pleasure
which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow."	59.4023
Lady
Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us, which
becomes herself and daughter.	60.3827
"Oh, yes!--if one could but go to Brighton!	49.4254
Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth's performance, mixing
with them many instructions on execution and taste.	57.6039
Mr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantle-piece with his eyes fixed
on her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than
surprise.	70.3478
You do not make allowance enough for difference of
situation and temper.	51.5516
I write rather slowly."	46.5476
Balls will be absolutely
prohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters.	50.4792
"I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins,--and
could say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of appearing
forward and precipitate.	41.2359
Mrs. Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham's desertion, and
complimented her on bearing it so well.	63.1863
"I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation," replied
Elizabeth, "but it is not in my power to accept it.--I must be in town
next Saturday."	30.4167
how I should like to be married before any of you; and then I would
chaperon you about to all the balls.	74.4224
What is it you are talking
of?	60.5154
said Miss Bingley; "will
she be as tall as I am?"	31.7516
it cannot be.	7.9946
However, I
recollected afterwards, that if he _had_ been prevented going, the
wedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done as well."	46.5246
"Ah!"	48.3580
Her character
will be fixed, and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt
that ever made herself and her family ridiculous.	93.8016
Their journey was performed without much conversation, or any alarm; and
within four hours of their leaving Hunsford, they reached Mr. Gardiner's
house, where they were to remain a few days.	51.7873
She wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss Bingley.	36.1566
Having never even fancied herself in
love before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment, and from
her age and disposition, greater steadiness than first attachments often
boast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance, and prefer him to
every other man, that all her good sense, and all her attention to the
feelings of her friends, were requisite to check the indulgence of those
regrets, which must have been injurious to her own health and their
tranquillity.	77.0856
cried Bingley.	14.3879
"If he does not come to me, _then_," said she, "I shall give him up for
ever."	21.1993
But don't imagine it was from
any silly cause.	39.6306
She read, with an eagerness which
hardly left her power of comprehension, and from impatience of knowing
what the next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the
sense of the one before her eyes.	61.0094
Remember that she is one of a
large family; that as to fortune, it is a most eligible match; and be
ready to believe, for every body's sake, that she may feel something
like regard and esteem for our cousin."	63.5379
With what delighted pride she
afterwards visited Mrs. Bingley and talked of Mrs. Darcy may be guessed.	183.9474
were questions with which she amused herself.	107.1460
It is as
often applied to feelings which arise from an half-hour's acquaintance,
as to a real, strong attachment.	84.9960
She finds Miss Pope a treasure.	129.2677
When she was discontented she
fancied herself nervous.	71.0067
He had followed them purposely to town, he had taken on himself all the
trouble and mortification attendant on such a research; in which
supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and
despise, and where he was reduced to meet, frequently meet, reason with,
persuade, and finally bribe, the man whom he always most wished to
avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce.	84.3537
But it must not, shall not be.	36.3658
Anxious and
uneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room, before the
gentlemen came, was wearisome and dull to a degree, that almost made her
uncivil.	66.8738
She then sat still five
minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she
suddenly got up, and saying to Kitty,

"Come here, my love, I want to speak to you," took her out of the room.	58.5422
I have
not the smallest hope.	30.6116
Miss Bingley's letter arrived, and put an end to doubt.	28.6209
Their reception at home was most kind.	50.0336
The farewell between herself and Mr. Wickham was perfectly friendly; on
his side even more.	52.8622
"Oh!	7.8559
Is not general incivility the very essence of love?"	104.2676
If you should have no objection to receive me
     into your house, I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on
     you and your family, Monday, November 18th, by four o'clock, and
     shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday
     se'night following, which I can do without any inconvenience, as
     Lady Catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a
     Sunday, provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the
     duty of the day.	74.1545
Mr. Bennet indeed said little; but the
ladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr. Collins seemed neither in need
of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself.	41.7116
The journey would moreover give her
a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have
been very sorry for any delay.	70.5093
She could only imagine however
at last, that she drew his notice because there was a something about
her more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than
in any other person present.	67.1839

"Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce
Mr. Bingley to _her_."	25.1177
No
     arguments shall be wanting on my part, that can alleviate so severe
     a misfortune; or that may comfort you, under a circumstance that
     must be of all others most afflicting to a parent's mind.	112.4876
CHAPTER X.


Elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter, as
soon as she possibly could.	37.5104
She had been unwilling to
mention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made
her equally avoid the name of his friend.	40.4100
And, above all things, keep Mr. Bennet from
fighting.	109.0551
"Indeed!"	12.8546
"I am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women.	81.2694
Lydia's thoughtlessness first betrayed to
me that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of course, I could
not rest till I knew the particulars.	52.9947
"Excuse my interference.--It was kindly meant."	71.8793
With a renewal of tenderness, however, they repaired to her room on
leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee.	40.4461
Why must _she_ be scampering about the
country, because her sister had a cold?	54.1156
This part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught by
Elizabeth, and as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for
Wickham's absence than if her first surmise had been just, every feeling
of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate
disappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to
the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to
make.--Attention, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to
Wickham.	80.0289
Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.	88.3388
Only think what an establishment it would
be for one of them.	54.5449
After tea, Mr. Bennet retired to the library, as was his
custom, and Mary went up stairs to her instrument.	41.0027
Believe her to be deceived by all means.	136.1973
I shall offer to pay him to-morrow; he will rant and storm about
his love for you, and there will be an end of the matter."	36.0151
On that head,
therefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself that
no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married."	79.6326
CHAPTER X.	15.1432
A small sum could not do all this."	58.5573
The one missent must be first attended to; it had been
written five days ago.	81.2926
It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger
daughters, as Jane's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of
other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be
able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that
she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked.	53.4904
In a few days more, we
may gain some news of them, and till we know that they are not married,
and have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as
lost.	48.5642
Every body said how well
she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with
her twice.	47.4121
Collins!"	75.5909
I am
perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are, that he never had any
design of engaging my affection.	56.1761
Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely
recollected her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which
had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth, seemed to have
fixed them on her more, and more cheerfully.	59.5474
"Upon my word I cannot exactly explain the matter, Darcy must speak for
himself."	42.4948
"Let her be called down.	44.3354
The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat, drink,
and sleep, and pursue the usual course of their employments.	52.9461
They agree with me in
     apprehending that this false step in one daughter, will be
     injurious to the fortunes of all the others, for who, as lady
     Catherine herself condescendingly says, will connect themselves
     with such a family.	75.2221
"All this she must possess," added Darcy, "and to all this she must yet
add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by
extensive reading."	67.7139
Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any
one; and all that I can hope in this case is, that she is deceived
herself."	63.0783
Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why I
come."	69.6495
The latter was much more
agreeable than his companion expected.	46.4072
cried Elizabeth when she had
finished it.	22.8211
I
can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor
sister.	51.7055
Pray forgive
     me, if I have been very presuming, or at least do not punish me so
     far, as to exclude me from P. I shall never be quite happy till I
     have been all round the park.	48.7289
She
would not listen therefore to her daughter's proposal of being carried
home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think
it at all advisable.	80.8272
She is quite a little
creature.	23.4709
The easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was
enough to provoke him.	28.2216
Mr. Collins to be sure was neither sensible nor
agreeable; his society was irksome, and his attachment to her must be
imaginary.	58.7130
"That is all very proper and civil, I am sure," said Mrs. Bennet, "and I
dare say she is a very agreeable woman.	21.1841
That Mr. Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham, before his arrival, but
without gaining any satisfactory information; and that he was now
determined to enquire at all the principal hotels in town, as Mr. Bennet
thought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on their first
coming to London, before they procured lodgings.	49.9515
said she, as she looked in
her face.	15.1917
I was sure you loved your girls too well to
neglect such an acquaintance.	63.6780
She perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation
between Wickham and herself, in their first evening at Mr. Philips's.	85.9350
Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners were very much admired at the parsonage,
and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of
their engagements at Rosings.	42.3678
that I had been with you, you have had every care and anxiety
upon yourself alone."	80.0692
They were more disturbed,
more unequal, than she had often seen them.	35.0561
"Yes," thought Elizabeth, "_that_ would be a delightful scheme, indeed,
and completely do for us at once.	42.3736
Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to
be under the greatest obligations to my father's active superintendance,
and when immediately before my father's death, Mr. Darcy gave him a
voluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it to
be as much a debt of gratitude to _him_, as of affection to myself."	59.3050
She saw that he wanted to engage her on
the old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge
him.	36.9276
Indeed he has no improper pride.	36.3170
The others then joined her, and expressed their admiration of his
figure; but Elizabeth heard not a word, and, wholly engrossed by her own
feelings, followed them in silence.	61.9291
"And did Colonel Forster appear to think ill of Wickham himself?	40.8690
I have no such injuries to resent.	33.3408
Her report was highly favourable.	50.8840
Oh!	7.8559
As she went up stairs to get ready, Mrs. Bennet followed her,
saying,

"I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that
disagreeable man all to yourself.	34.5171
Elizabeth hoped she had
silenced him; but he soon afterwards said,

"I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month.	43.8759
"That is not an unnatural surmise," said Fitzwilliam, "but it is
lessening the honour of my cousin's triumph very sadly."	54.9223
"Yes, very well.	20.6004
said Elizabeth.	15.3852
Darcy said very
little, and Mr. Hurst nothing at all.	42.1318
You have no compassion on my poor nerves."	43.1893
But the fact is, that
being, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured
father, (who, however, may live many years longer,) I could not satisfy
myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters, that
the loss to them might be as little as possible, when the melancholy
event takes place--which, however, as I have already said, may not be
for several years.	67.1060
"Kitty and I are going upstairs to sit in
my dressing-room."	65.5948
Do you not know that such a
report is spread abroad?"	46.0687
of all his sister's falsehood and contrivance!	64.8774
"It is evident by this," added Jane, "that he comes back no more this
winter."	38.8616
"But there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her, so
soon after this event."	80.8832
He placed himself by her.	85.9948
"Oh!	7.8559
"But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be
observed in them for ever."	72.3500
She found it difficult to obtain even a word from
her beyond a monosyllable.	76.9871
I can recal nothing worse.	39.7933
and it is such a
good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning, and never said
a word about it till now."	32.9474
But, perhaps his sister does as well
for the present, and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he
likes with her."	67.2844
From these instructions they were summoned by the
arrival of the coach, and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr.
Collins's side, and as many bows on Sir William's, they departed.	54.1334
Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed to
make any reply.	49.8765
She longed to enquire of the housekeeper, whether her master were really
absent, but had not courage for it.	37.5879
Elizabeth did not know what to make of it.	17.0833
I have a warm, unguarded temper, and I
may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too
freely.	58.0827
She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, till
late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep, and
when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go
down stairs herself.	41.6603
Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little
Miss De Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish, and fearing she
were indisposed.	76.1784
Her dirty petticoat
quite escaped my notice."	144.4643
When the ladies removed after dinner, Elizabeth ran up to her sister,
and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the
drawing-room; where she was welcomed by her two friends with many
professions of pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable
as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared.	58.5357
Mr. Wickham
had received his commission before he left London, and he was to join
his regiment at the end of a fortnight.	39.9400
"I hope not."	39.0284
There was no want of discourse.	17.4676
She supposed, if he meant any thing, he must mean an allusion to what
might arise in that quarter.	72.0356
The pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his
side, by preparations for the reception of his bride, as he had reason
to hope, that shortly after his next return into Hertfordshire, the day
would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men.	49.5240
The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.	156.1139
"Who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help feeling an
interest in him?"	115.2396
However, he
wrote some verses on her, and very pretty they were."	66.3140
"I dislike it very much," he replied; "but it must be done."	28.8075
Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined.	65.3986
But that
gentleman," looking at Darcy, "seemed to think the country was nothing
at all."	53.0113
and so extremely
accomplished for her age!	45.1843
While
there was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt with him; and while
Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they would be going there for
ever.	77.7239
I think I have heard you say that you know them."	18.6151
I will not spend _my_ hours in
running after my neighbours every time they go away, and come back
again."	59.6203
VOL.	115.6968
Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of
these transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr.
Gardiner's behaviour laid them all under.	74.8295
The distance is nothing,
when one has a motive; only three miles.	78.0368
Nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and Lydia led
voluntarily to subjects, which her sisters would not have alluded to for
the world.	58.0619
I would keep a pack of
foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine every day."	57.7606
Her tour to the Lakes
was now the object of her happiest thoughts; it was her best consolation
for all the uncomfortable hours, which the discontentedness of her
mother and Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included Jane in
the scheme, every part of it would have been perfect.	62.1221
cried
Jane.	14.8104
The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly.	105.4317
If there _were_ but
such another man for you!"	62.4019
Presuming, however,
that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment, than
any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of
society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for
her attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.	59.2285
"I must not decide on my own performance."	24.2548
Mr. Gardiner would be prevented by business from
setting out till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London again
within a month; and as that left too short a period for them to go so
far, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with
the leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up
the Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour; and, according to the
present plan, were to go no farther northward than Derbyshire.	71.0387
Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as
his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having
no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the
moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the
observances which he supposed a regular part of the business.	79.7364
He promises fairly, and I hope among different people,
     where they may each have a character to preserve, they will both be
     more prudent.	96.5317
"But you are not entitled to know _mine_; nor will such behaviour as
this, ever induce me to be explicit."	56.6299
I have nothing either to hope or fear,
and nothing to reproach him with.	70.2939
In town I believe he chiefly lived, but his
     studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free from all
     restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation.	76.7406
But if I go on, I shall displease you by saying what
I think of persons you esteem.	52.8255
_You_ know him too well to doubt the rest.	47.5420
Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness.	43.0276
Fatigued as she had been by the morning's walk, they had
no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former
acquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an
intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance.	53.4838
You are safe from me."	21.9263
And you saw the
old housekeeper, I suppose?	52.1463
"And so was I."	80.5375
"I beg you would not put it into Lizzy's head to be vexed by his
ill-treatment; for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite
a misfortune to be liked by him.	52.9354
As for Jane, _her_ anxiety under this suspence was, of course, more
painful than Elizabeth's; but whatever she felt she was desirous of
concealing, and between herself and Elizabeth, therefore, the subject
was never alluded to.	75.8163
The separation
between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic.	69.7875
said
Jane.--"I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her."	33.4279
you do not know what I suffer."	18.3900
"Could I expect it to be otherwise!"	45.2872
She was very
equal therefore to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the ball, and
abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most
shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it.	36.6139
To be sure London was
rather thin, but however the little Theatre was open.	119.2025
"She is so fond of Mrs. Forster," said she, "it will be quite shocking
to send her away!	28.0193
Oh!	7.8559
Mr. Darcy handed the ladies
into the carriage, and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw him walking
slowly towards the house.	41.1465
She was teazed by
Mr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side, and though he
could not prevail with her to dance with him again, put it out of her
power to dance with others.	34.1136
No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and her
acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful.	44.4801
His sisters were fine women,
with an air of decided fashion.	46.5880
"You are mistaken.	21.3937
"Hate you!	263.1349
"Oh!	7.8559
I will read it to you--

"When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which
took him to London, might be concluded in three or four days, but as we
are certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when
Charles gets to town, he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have
determined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend
his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel.	59.8484
They walked on, without knowing in what direction.	46.0627
His marriage was
now fast approaching, and she was at length so far resigned as to think
it inevitable, and even repeatedly to say in an ill-natured tone that
she "_wished_ they might be happy."	52.5821
Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in my
life, as I have this evening; and there are several of them you see
uncommonly pretty."	62.1051
I cannot
     understand it.	12.2618
On Miss Lucas's persevering, however,
she added, "Very well; if it must be so, it must."	38.5836
They had been walking about the
place with some of their new friends, and were just returned to the inn
to dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a
carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and lady in a
curricle, driving up the street.	71.9715
The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a
fourth.	95.9099
"A little sea-bathing would set me up for ever."	116.9601
"Yes, he went on Tuesday as I wrote you word."	37.2449
All was joy and
kindness.	79.9383
Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital.	53.0255
In spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to
the compliment of such a man's affection, and though her intentions did
not vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to
receive; till, roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she lost
all compassion in anger.	56.7796
We dine at Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed to
walk home.	92.4770
My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light
it places Mr. Darcy, to be treating his father's favourite in such a
manner,--one, whom his father had promised to provide for.--It is
impossible.	62.6678
Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; any thing was a
welcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs. Collins's pretty friend had
moreover caught his fancy very much.	59.9007
She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on
which there could be no difference of sentiment.	70.6027
She could not think of Darcy's leaving Kent, without remembering that
his cousin was to go with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear
that he had no intentions at all, and agreeable as he was, she did not
mean to be unhappy about him.	41.0899
"A gamester!"	85.9781
Colonel Fitzwilliam was no
longer an object.	19.0450
cried he, with more feeling than
politeness; then recollecting himself, "I will not detain you a minute,
but let me, or let the servant, go after Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner.	75.6173
Though Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich,
     he would have been able to do something for him, and his situation
     must have been benefited by marriage.	30.3563
It was to be such a secret!"	27.1022
"He is certainly a good brother," said Elizabeth, as she walked towards
one of the windows.	23.4334
Miss Bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her great
anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane, received some
assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.	70.5440
He sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkably
good spirits.	51.8211
His father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best men
that ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never be
in company with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a
thousand tender recollections.	65.5494
"Which do you mean?"	50.0608
You have
withheld the advantages, which you must know to have been designed for
him.	27.7004
But it has been the study of
my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong
understanding to ridicule."	66.4027
But I make no doubt, they
often talk of it between themselves.	45.7001
I certainly _have_ had my share of beauty, but
I do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now.	28.5636
Among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is a
very different man from what he is to the less prosperous.	88.3577
Mrs.
Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydia's
interruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he would
resume his book; but Mr. Collins, after assuring them that he bore his
young cousin no ill will, and should never resent her behaviour as any
affront, seated himself at another table with Mr. Bennet, and prepared
for backgammon.	61.3574
"But not before they went to Brighton?"	45.0637
I have not been accustomed to such
language as this.	52.1925
she cried.--"I, who have prided myself on
my discernment!--I, who have valued myself on my abilities!	109.5563
If _he_
wishes to avoid seeing _me_, he must go.	49.6440
"And this," said she, "is the end of all his friend's anxious
circumspection!	29.8522
The fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officious
attention.	51.3108
He was a tall,
heavy looking young man of five and twenty.	55.7625
I was not in a humour to
wait for any opening of your's.	44.3001
"Miss Bingley told me," said Jane, "that he never speaks much unless
among his intimate acquaintance.	50.9903
It was very little less.	28.0416
"What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him?	31.1153
"_You_ were Mr. Bingley's first choice."	42.8112
"My dear Eliza he must be in love with you, or he would never have
called on us in this familiar way."	47.1598
"Oh!	7.8559
"I _did_ hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-making was not so
palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actually
declared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business
had been compromised accordingly."	75.7277
"Yes, and I had heard it before.	26.0125
But
nothing can be done; I know very well that nothing can be done.	48.0847
And when I returned home, the ----shire
was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight's time.	58.3770
Have not you always hated him?"	49.4423
After discharging
his conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many
rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection
of their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained that it was
merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready
to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn, whither
he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight; for Lady Catherine,
he added, so heartily approved his marriage, that she wished it to take
place as soon as possible, which he trusted would be an unanswerable
argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him
the happiest of men.	60.3314
"My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in
     her better judgment, at my expence, when I confess myself to have
     been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley's regard for me.	45.9443
But vanity, not love, has been my
folly.--Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect
of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted
prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where either were
concerned.	63.9899
It has been most unconsciously done, however, and I hope will be of
short duration.	40.8901
"Let me first see how he behaves," said she; "it will then be early
enough for expectation."	80.1688
She was engaged one day as she walked, in re-perusing Jane's last
letter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not
written in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by Mr. Darcy,
she saw on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her.	54.9231
It was to this effect:

     "Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred of
     a most unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of alarming
     you--be assured that we are all well.	101.8307
"And my mother--How is she?	69.7747
But Jane was to go home with her, and at
Longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation.	30.3851
Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for
being simply dressed.	66.2875
CHAPTER VIII.	15.1432
The
happiness which this reply produced, was such as he had probably never
felt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as
warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do.	73.9681
Mr. Bingley had not been of
age two years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to
look at Netherfield House.	38.9269
"If we make haste," said Lydia, as they walked along, "perhaps we may
see something of Captain Carter before he goes."	52.6564
Ignorant as you previously were of every thing
     concerning either, detection could not be in your power, and
     suspicion certainly not in your inclination.	72.1161
A fortnight's acquaintance is certainly
very little.	57.3206
Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them.	57.1515
Mrs. Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth returned
instantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations' behaviour to the
remarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the latter of whom, however,
could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _her_, in spite of
all Miss Bingley's witticisms on _fine eyes_.	43.5550
Will you come and see me?"	81.3146
dear me!	32.9588
I appeal to Mr. Darcy:--but let me not interrupt you,
Sir.--You will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching
converse of that young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me."	58.3703
Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy's marriage; but as she
thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley, she
dropt all her resentment; was fonder than ever of Georgiana, almost as
attentive to Darcy as heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility
to Elizabeth.	77.5749
"'Tis too much!"	164.6290
On reaching the spacious lobby above, they were shewn into a very
pretty sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and
lightness than the apartments below; and were informed that it was but
just done, to give pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a liking to the
room, when last at Pemberley.	74.5150
His former acquaintance had been numerous; but since he had been in the
militia, it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship
with any of them.	60.9460
They were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her mother's
tea.	25.6113
She dared not
even mention that gentleman.	33.0913
If he had not had a family of his own, I and my children
must have had all his money you know, and it is the first time we have
ever had any thing from him, except a few presents.	65.2082
One has got all the goodness, and the other all the
appearance of it."	43.4447
"If you believed it impossible to be true," said Elizabeth, colouring
with astonishment and disdain, "I wonder you took the trouble of coming
so far.	32.0659
How wonderfully these sort of things occur!	136.9760
"What does Mr. Darcy mean," said she to Charlotte, "by listening to my
conversation with Colonel Forster?"	45.4041
They saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now
added that of general unreserve.	83.6734
As soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was
ordered; and after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their
boxes, workbags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of Kitty's and
Lydia's purchases, were seated in it.	64.5225
Mr. Darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her
hand; but in vain.	65.8616
Has it not been
industriously circulated by yourselves?	117.6784
Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing
her, she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with
composure.	41.9668
"Do let us have a little music,"--cried Miss Bingley, tired of a
conversation in which she had no share.--"Louisa, you will not mind my
waking Mr.	52.5966
Till I have your disposition, your goodness, I never can have your
happiness.	52.9158
Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.	16.5999
What
could be more natural than his asking you again?	57.0103
And in the wretched state of his own
finances, there was a very powerful motive for secrecy, in addition to
his fear of discovery by Lydia's relations, for it had just transpired
that he had left gaming debts behind him, to a very considerable
amount.	56.0164
yes--I understand you perfectly."	31.8948
CHAPTER IV.	15.1432
"The
party seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other.	105.7260
But if you are really innocent and
     ignorant, I must be more explicit.	34.7705
We had better not mention it.	41.7697
He concluded with
representing to her the strength of that attachment which, in spite of
all his endeavours, he had found impossible to conquer; and with
expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of
his hand.	49.5695
Elizabeth received her
congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took
refuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom.	49.4411
"Neglect!	57.2470
"I am sure there is not on _his_.	14.9201
He was seriously concerned, that a cause of so little advantage to any
one, should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother-in-law, and
he was determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his
assistance, and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could.	46.1093
I congratulate her.	24.0567
He readily assured her of his secrecy--again expressed his sorrow for
her distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present
reason to hope, and leaving his compliments for her relations, with only
one serious, parting, look, went away.	71.9656
Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton the day
     before, not many hours after the express.	68.9485
"Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine, what is to
befall her?"	61.7130
He had certainly formed such a plan, and without
meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss
Bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern
for the welfare of his friend.	54.7104
"They are generally long; but whether always charming, it is not for me
to determine."	93.9626
At length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and
the others returned into the house.	36.0180
"I cannot make him
out.--There is something very pompous in his style.--And what can he
mean by apologizing for being next in the entail?--We cannot suppose he
would help it, if he could.--Can he be a sensible man, sir?"	88.1743
I will go directly to Mr. Bennet, and
we shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure."	33.7946
For such an attachment
as this, she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not
suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement, without the
intention of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither
her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy
prey.	64.5580
But the person who advanced, was now
near enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness, pronounced
her name.	45.6155
Elizabeth was distressed.	25.2932
Miss Bennet paused a little and then replied, "Surely there can be no
occasion for exposing him so dreadfully.	48.4599
You have delighted us long enough.	36.1129
Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he
spoke, his accent had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his
enquiries as to the time of her having left Longbourn, and of her stay
in Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the
distraction of his thoughts.	70.4937
Who would have thought she could be so thin and small!"	50.4204
"John told us Mr. Darcy was
here when you sent for us;--was it so?"	132.6240
"I must think your language too strong in speaking of both," replied
Jane, "and I hope you will be convinced of it, by seeing them happy
together.	29.1376
Smiles decked the face of Mrs. Bennet, as the carriage drove up to
the door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed,
anxious, uneasy.	149.0473
I will only add, God bless you.	68.3857
To such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would make no
reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, if he
persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering
encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered
in such a manner as must be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could
not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.	83.3216
She was not equal,
however, to much conversation, and when Miss Bingley left them together,
could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the
extraordinary kindness she was treated with.	63.8019
CHAPTER VI.	15.1432
They now walked on in silence; each of them deep in thought.	58.2363
He was struggling for the
appearance of composure, and would not open his lips, till he believed
himself to have attained it.	40.2794
"Oh, Jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of him,
this could not have happened!"	63.5185
Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as
acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr. Darcy had been, was much
relieved by discerning such different feelings.	49.8445
I quite detest the man."	55.9545
"Oh!	7.8559
"Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it would never
be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my uncle and aunt
were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them.	53.8958
To
this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying.	154.9389
Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends?	39.4179
They could
have been understood only by her mother, who might have felt nearly the
same.	32.7103
The conversation soon turned upon fishing, and she heard Mr. Darcy
invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he
chose, while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same
time to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of
the stream where there was usually most sport.	62.4002
The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering
visitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his
wife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity of
doing it should be given so soon, was such an instance of Lady
Catherine's condescension as he knew not how to admire enough.	73.3193
Lady
Catherine de Bourgh's attention to his wishes, and consideration for his
comfort, appeared very remarkable.	53.8176
Had they fixed on any other man
it would have been nothing; but _his_ perfect indifference, and _your_
pointed dislike, make it so delightfully absurd!	74.2074
Letters of business too!	136.1215
If she heard me,
     it was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen.	29.4484
"I should never have said Mrs. Collins
was settled _near_ her family."	32.5758
My father bears it better.	59.4855
"This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy.	50.2163
Yes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her invitation was
accepted with alacrity.	56.9389
I guessed as much."	51.2510
He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very
great!	54.7317
Lizzy declares she will not have Mr. Collins,
and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy."	30.1267
But slyness seems the fashion.	55.1047
With all these circumstances to
favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest
Jane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness
of so many?"	79.9993
Mrs. Bennet rejoiced to see Jane
in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did Mr. Bennet
say voluntarily to Elizabeth,

"I am glad you are come back, Lizzy."	56.2458
I am not indebted for my present happiness to
your eager desire of expressing your gratitude.	61.4983
When to these recollections was added the developement of Wickham's
character, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had
seldom been depressed before, were now so much affected as to make it
almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful.	68.5509
She was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself; and to
him she had hardly courage to speak.	53.6499
"Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into
Hertfordshire this winter.	95.4922
My aunt Philips wants you so to
get husbands, you can't think.	43.7739
I must find Mr. Gardiner this moment, on business that cannot be
delayed; I have not an instant to lose."	50.7296
What are men
to rocks and mountains?	114.8116
Only think of _that_ my dear; he actually danced with her
twice; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second
time.	47.4932
"Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may.	108.9711
The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire, you must know,
was at a ball--and at this ball, what do you think he did?	50.6170
They repulsed
every attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and by so doing, threw a
languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the
long speeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr. Bingley and his
sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and
politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests.	65.9278
If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy

She does not yet leave her dressing-room.	18.7705
She held out her hand; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry, though
he hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house.	55.3963
She had been graciously pleased to
approve of both the discourses, which he had already had the honour of
preaching before her.	48.6406
She stood several minutes before the picture in
earnest contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the
gallery.	64.4749
"I should like balls infinitely better," she replied, "if they were
carried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably
tedious in the usual process of such a meeting.	64.8687
About the Court, such
instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon."	161.3783
It amazes
me, I confess;--for certainly, there can be nothing so advantageous to
them as instruction.	50.5553
That he was not a good-tempered man, had been her firmest
opinion.	31.8809
On entering the drawing-room she found the whole
party at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting
them to be playing high she declined it, and making her sister the
excuse, said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay
below with a book.	73.7543
Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her
immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving
alarm or inconvenience, from expressing in her note how much she longed
for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance.	53.8958
She wished him to
know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the
place, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been
very unexpected--"for your housekeeper," she added, "informed us that
you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and indeed, before we
left Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected in
the country."	46.5145
He has been here
this half hour, and master has had a letter."	58.3434
She wanted to ascertain the
feelings of each of her visitors, she wanted to compose her own, and to
make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she
feared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom she
endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour.	49.2028
"If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield,"
said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, "and all the others equally well
married, I shall have nothing to wish for."	46.1498
The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information, was
as sincere as her brother's in sending it.	52.2994
I cannot but wonder,
     however, at her having any such fears now, because, if he had at
     all cared about me, we must have met long, long ago.	55.1467
"Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say.	28.2101
Have you never
happened to see her there?"	46.4110
The
officers of the ----shire were in general a very creditable,
gentleman-like set, and the best of them were of the present party; but
Mr. Wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and
walk, as _they_ were superior to the broad-faced stuffy uncle Philips,
breathing port wine, who followed them into the room.	70.3044
You
     will easily comprehend, from these particulars, that Mr. Wickham's
     circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to
     be.	40.5571
"I should like to know how he behaves among strangers."	55.7361
They saw much to
interest, but nothing to justify enquiry.	61.1390
do you then pretend to be ignorant of it?	39.1854
cried Lydia.	17.5557
It is not
of peculiar, but of general evils, which I am now complaining.	49.3196
Lydia left a few lines for his wife,
     informing her of their intention.	47.8218
Though Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging Lady
Catherine, have answered this question; she could not but say, after a
moment's deliberation,

"I am not."	47.3106
Elizabeth was so much caught by what passed, as to leave her very little
attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near
the card-table, and stationed herself between Mr. Bingley and his eldest
sister, to observe the game.	59.8421
An hour, however, saw the whole completed; and Mr.
Gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn, nothing
remained to be done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all the misery of
the morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could
have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to Longbourn.	54.9647
Charlotte did not stay much
longer, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard.	40.2031
"How should you have liked making sermons?"	172.7061
I remember the time when I
liked a red coat myself very well--and indeed so I do still at my heart;
and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year, should
want one of my girls, I shall not say nay to him; and I thought Colonel
Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William's in his
regimentals."	84.9790
Neither could
any thing be urged against my father, who, though with some
peculiarities, has abilities which Mr. Darcy himself need not disdain,
and respectability which he will probably never reach."	93.9282
here comes Hill.	103.5649
Elizabeth silently attended
her.	32.3060
As a brother, a landlord, a master, she
considered how many people's happiness were in his guardianship!--How
much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow!--How much of
good or evil must be done by him!	80.3491
Miss Bennet accepted her aunt's invitation with pleasure; and the
Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time, than as she
hoped that, by Caroline's not living in the same house with her brother,
she might occasionally spend a morning with her, without any danger of
seeing him.	63.9966
The moral will be perfectly fair.	71.3147
You may remember
what I told you on that point, when first we talked of it."	46.4926
Young ladies of her age, are sometimes a
little difficult to manage, and if she has the true Darcy spirit, she
may like to have her own way."	63.6196
It is enough to know they are discovered, I have seen them
     both----"

"Then it is, as I always hoped," cried Jane; "they are married!"	52.5459
"Upon my word I say no more _here_ than I might say in any house in the
neighbourhood, except Netherfield.	55.8246
"Having thus
offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs. Collins and myself on
this happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another:
of which we have been advertised by the same authority.	77.1759
"Mama," cried Lydia, "my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain
Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson's as they did when they first
came; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke's library."	92.7349
I must beg, therefore, to be importuned no farther on the
subject."	30.4030
But your
_family_ owe me nothing.	82.1239
The attention of
the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by _him_.	42.6358
But on the third morning after his
arrival in Hertfordshire, she saw him from her dressing-room window,
enter the paddock, and ride towards the house.	31.7419
"Really, Mr. Collins," cried Elizabeth with some warmth, "you puzzle me
exceedingly.	74.0270
Miss Bingley made no answer; and soon afterwards got up and walked about
the room.	34.3418
"And what am I to do on the occasion?--It seems an hopeless business."	83.9002
Mrs. Bennet could hardly
contain herself.	20.7011
"I am sure," said she, "I cried for two days together when Colonel
Millar's regiment went away.	65.7819
"Because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it.	78.2917
I want to be told whether I
ought, or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand
Wickham's character."	48.3671
Philips.--The usual inquiries as to his success were
made by the latter.	145.9544
"Very, very much.	90.3594
"It certainly is a most iniquitous affair," said Mr. Bennet, "and
nothing can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn.	35.0989
the
happiest, wisest, most reasonable end!"	126.5449
"This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure,"
said he.	19.6533
From that moment I
     observed my friend's behaviour attentively; and I could then
     perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had
     ever witnessed in him.	77.6887
Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence.	41.0938
my dear Mr. Bennet," as she entered the room, "we have had a most
delightful evening, a most excellent ball.	28.5138
But he had given a reason for his interference, which asked no
extraordinary stretch of belief.	66.5286
But now it comes out."	46.7119
I wonder when
you _would_ have spoken, if I had not asked you!	41.6169
'Ah!	48.3580
Convinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley's dislike of her had
originated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how very unwelcome
her appearance at Pemberley must be to her, and was curious to know with
how much civility on that lady's side, the acquaintance would now be
renewed.	72.5606
"We may as well leave them by themselves you know;" said her mother as
soon as she was in the hall.	54.6528
PRIDE & PREJUDICE.	108.5389
The turn of your countenance I shall never
forget, as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible
way, that would induce you to accept me."	50.4232
Mr. Collins, awkward and solemn,
apologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong without being
aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable
partner for a couple of dances can give.	84.4651
Regard for my sister's credit and feelings
     prevented any public exposure, but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left
     the place immediately, and Mrs. Younge was of course removed from
     her charge.	67.3674
Were the same fair prospect to arise at present, as had
flattered them a year ago, every thing, she was persuaded, would be
hastening to the same vexatious conclusion.	73.8791
My dear Lizzy, they must
     have passed within ten miles of us.	28.9526
YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.	90.8050
But what is that to me?	43.3994
"Laugh as much as you chuse, but you will not laugh me out of my
opinion.	33.5920
Do not imagine me ignorant of their
condition."	37.2226
Elizabeth could bear it no longer.	26.1681
"You are very cruel," said her sister, "you will not let me smile, and
are provoking me to it every moment."	36.9668
Oh!	7.8559
"And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be
Bingley.	50.6576
"Nay," said Elizabeth, "this is not fair.	21.4617
Her own thoughts were employing her.	60.9859
It was too early in the morning for visitors, and besides, the
equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours.	63.1247
"But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see
what he is about.	49.5142
"I am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley's conduct to design,"
said Elizabeth; "but without scheming to do wrong, or to make others
unhappy, there may be error, and there may be misery.	42.3384
The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth
much attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothing
but think, and think with wonder, of Mr. Darcy's civility, and above
all, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister.	70.6975
With such rivals for the notice of the fair, as Mr. Wickham and the
officers, Mr. Collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance; to the
young ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a
kind listener in Mrs. Philips, and was, by her watchfulness, most
abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin.	67.6557
"I should not be surprised," said Darcy, "if he were to give it up, as
soon as any eligible purchase offers."	26.7819
In the next room is a
new instrument just come down for her--a present from my master; she
comes here to-morrow with him."	84.2146
When the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to be
done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without any
intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every
subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have
her judgment controverted.	58.5628
I always thought they were very unfit to have
the charge of her; but I was over-ruled, as I always am.	57.2666
"Lizzy, you must not do so.	27.5450
The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs. Reynolds
was of no trifling nature.	76.6485
London:

Military Library, Whitehall.	29.2040
It may only be

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.	52.4885
"Oh!	7.8559
They walked towards the Lucases, because Kitty wished to call upon
Maria; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern,
when Kitty left them, she went boldly on with him alone.	85.6827
What say you,
Mary?	81.1767
Do let me ask my partner to introduce you."	38.5063
"Wickham so
very bad!	81.6345
But she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner's curiosity; it was
not their wish to force her communication.	36.3340
After making
     every possible enquiry on that side London, Colonel F. came on into
     Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes, and at
     the inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but without any success, no such
     people had been seen to pass through.	89.6496
"But depend upon it, Mr. Collins," she added, "that Lizzy shall be
brought to reason.	28.7413
"How near it may be to _mine_, I cannot pretend to say.--_You_
think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly."	41.7198
Mr. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted
by the Gardiners and Jane; but as he took up his abode with the Lucases,
his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs. Bennet.	66.7197
You know I always
speak my mind, and I cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling
post by themselves.	38.1005
"I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship.	43.7582
Elizabeth did all she could, to shield
him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to keep him
to herself, and to those of her family with whom he might converse
without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising
from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure, it
added to the hope of the future; and she looked forward with delight to
the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to
either, to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at
Pemberley.	64.1558
Your superior knowledge of your sister must make
     the latter probable.--If it be so, if I have been misled by such
     error, to inflict pain on her, your resentment has not been
     unreasonable.	74.0753
But perhaps Mr. Bingley did
not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as
for his own, and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same
principle."	36.7937
You could not have met with a person more capable of
giving you certain information on that head than myself--for I have been
connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy."	61.8588
The express was sent off directly.	59.2238
"But if you have got them to-day," said Elizabeth, "my mother's purpose
will be answered."	30.1237
It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire,
nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither
lay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenelworth, Birmingham, &c. are
sufficiently known.	92.5144
GARDINER."	55.4642
It is a nice long walk, and Mr. Darcy has
never seen the view."	37.9602
"Speak to Lizzy about it yourself.	132.5690
"Pride," observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her
reflections, "is a very common failing I believe.	77.5024
She talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of them till
they were joined by Mr. Collins, who entered with an air more stately
than usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to the girls,

"Now, I do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, and
let Mr. Collins and me have a little conversation together."	57.5852
In Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one
of the officers' wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing
field after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing
over puddles with impatient activity, and finding herself at last within
view of the house, with weary ancles, dirty stockings, and a face
glowing with the warmth of exercise.	76.3894
At such an assembly as this, it
would be insupportable.	49.1195
CHAPTER XVIII.	15.1432
thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia!"	112.9563
That he had been concerned in the measures
taken to separate Mr. Bingley and Jane, she had never doubted; but she
had always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and
arrangement of them.	43.5418
And, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the
Barnet road."	60.4186
Mrs. Bennet said only, "Nonsense,
nonsense!"	28.3440
Through letters,
whatever of good or bad was to be told, would be communicated, and every
succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance.	75.4555
Fixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self reproach, she could find
no interval of ease or forgetfulness.	107.9850
You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love
you."	45.0376
Jane's temper was not desponding, and she was gradually led to hope,
though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that
Bingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart.	69.6027
Elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here; for to
acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.	68.1033
They may be there, though
for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptionable purpose.	64.5373
Nobody can tell what I
suffer!--But it is always so.	88.8733
The gentlemen
pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was
much handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great
admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust
which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be
proud, to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his
large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most
forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared
with his friend.	65.0816
Within doors there
was Lady Catherine, books, and a billiard table, but gentlemen cannot be
always within doors; and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the
pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the
two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither
almost every day.	66.8607
Your
portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the
effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications.	79.1681
There can be no love in all this.	22.7074
YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.	89.2654
U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.	513.5994
"My father and Maria are to come to me in March," added Charlotte, "and
I hope you will consent to be of the party.	39.9577
But, on second thoughts,
perhaps Lizzy could tell us, what relations he has now living, better
than any other person."	85.3054
A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without
scolding her, a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William
or Lady Lucas without being rude, and many months were gone before she
could at all forgive their daughter.	65.0151
But he found Lydia
     absolutely resolved on remaining where she was.	100.4696
I thought
we never should have got into the coach.	28.1781
One cannot wonder that so
very fine a young man, with family, fortune, every thing in his favour,
should think highly of himself.	64.3604

_He_ was
     exactly what he had been, when I knew him in Hertfordshire; but I
     would not tell you how little I was satisfied with _her_ behaviour
     while she staid with us, if I had not perceived, by Jane's letter
     last Wednesday, that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a
     piece with it, and therefore what I now tell you, can give you no
     fresh pain.	56.0149
1.F.6.	84.8445
Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her, though
the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no horse-woman, walking
was her only alternative.	59.6003
my dear," continued Mrs. Bennet, "I am quite delighted with him.	15.0247
On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew
to Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last
partner she had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them and
told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to
make a most important discovery.	57.5518
This was agreed to, and Mrs. Philips
protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery
tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards.	53.1603
Miss Bingley's eyes were instantly turned towards Darcy, and she had
something to say to him before he had advanced many steps.	51.1989
"I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long," said Miss Lucas, "but I
wish he had danced with Eliza."	37.3360
As her successor in that house, she
regarded her with jealous abhorrence.	70.1083
On Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr. Collins met for breakfast a few
minutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity of
paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary.	85.7666
Mrs. Gardiner, who was several years younger than
Mrs. Bennet and Mrs. Philips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant
woman, and a great favourite with all her Longbourn nieces.	49.9704
She paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening
with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse.	58.0029
Collins."	61.3358
"I hope," said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery the
next day, "you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this
desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue;
and if you can compass it, do cure the younger girls of running after
the officers.--And, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to
check that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence,
which your lady possesses."	63.7062
The Netherfield
ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by
trade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so well
bred and agreeable.	48.9343
They must have seen them together for ever."	26.4123
My poor mother is really ill
     and keeps her room.	56.4277
A few weeks, he believed.	35.3563
Mr. Darcy has not authorised me to
make his communication public.	42.2707
You
would have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this little
unwillingness; but allow me to assure you that I have your respected
mother's permission for this address.	85.3935
She was therefore obliged to seek another branch
of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some
exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.	45.4233
I am not ashamed of having been
mistaken--or, at least, it is slight, it is nothing in comparison of
what I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters.	45.4443
Darcy was delighted with
their engagement; his friend had given him the earliest information of
it.	57.0017
Their father then went to the
library to write, and the girls walked into the breakfast-room.	37.1993
Mr. Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection for her
drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do.	87.3524
After a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with

"It is _your_ turn to say something now, Mr.	71.8150
As she pronounced these words, Mr. Darcy changed colour; but the emotion
was short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she
continued.	79.9404
But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least it
was impossible not to try for information.	63.9829
"Yes, indeed," cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a
country neighbourhood.	33.9314
She told the story
however with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively,
playful disposition, which delighted in any thing ridiculous.	86.1934
This observation would not have prevented her
from trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an
inconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity
of saying much.	53.6520
She followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell
her, was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner
connected with the letter he held.	54.7428
Wholly inattentive to her sister's feelings, Lydia flew
about the house in restless ecstacy, calling for every one's
congratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever;
whilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate
in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish.	96.6127
Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a
valuable neighbour to Mrs.	56.0170
Mr. Robinson's asking him how he liked our Meryton
assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty
women in the room, and _which_ he thought the prettiest?	60.2986
They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the
world.	41.2272
"Oh!	7.8559
It could not be for society, as he frequently sat there
ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak, it
seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice--a sacrifice to
propriety, not a pleasure to himself.	86.6021
"But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side," said Jane.	22.6053
"This is a parade," cried he, "which does one good; it gives such an
elegance to misfortune!	69.9108
She was
going to the butcher's, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat on
Wednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks, just fit to be
killed."	51.1228
Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so--but still they admired
her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom
they should not object to know more of.	38.4594
I never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me wrong.	68.2667
And one of my
own daughters.	23.6608
Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had the
unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in
a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer.	50.9833
Perhaps there was some truth in
     _this_; though I doubt whether _his_ reserve, or _anybody's_
     reserve, can be answerable for the event.	83.5079
"While Mary is adjusting her ideas," he continued, "let us return to Mr.	42.0599
"And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?"	82.2170
"He is just what a young man ought to be," said she, "sensible, good
humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!--so much ease,
with such perfect good breeding!"	61.2455
For my part, I am determined never to speak
of it again to anybody.	56.8767
"But you forget, mama," said Elizabeth, "that we shall meet him at the
assemblies, and that Mrs. Long has promised to introduce him."	30.7295
Elizabeth said no more--but her mind could not acquiesce.	49.4242
Yours ever,

     "CAROLINE BINGLEY."	178.6443
Section 1.	125.3899
"To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is,
above her ancles in dirt, and alone, quite alone!	88.9770
hang Kitty!	733.2245
And there is something of dignity in his countenance, that
would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart.	37.5598
"You have reduced
him to his present state of poverty, comparative poverty.	59.0054
Good Heaven!	40.6780
It is excellent news, capital news, and about
a certain person that we all like."	80.3498
We must trespass
a little longer on your kindness."	46.9369
It is a pity they are not handsome!	48.9200
To no creature had it been revealed, where secresy was
possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley's connections her
brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from that very wish
which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming
hereafter her own.	96.0500
How strange must it appear to him!	102.6121
When, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment
she soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy, she turned her eyes on the
daughter, she could almost have joined in Maria's astonishment, at her
being so thin, and so small.	55.3527
"Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?"	22.9391
Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than
ever as he expressed them.	61.3339
I quite forgot!	51.6194
You shall not defend her,
though it is Charlotte Lucas.	47.6885
She wished, she
feared that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether
she wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine.	61.6238
It was not to be supposed that any other
people could be meant than those with whom she was connected.	40.5533
Vanity and pride are different
things, though the words are often used synonimously.	145.4438
But now several minutes elapsed,
without bringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable
to resist the impulse of curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she
as often found him looking at Jane, as at herself, and frequently on no
object but the ground.	73.5739
I am
perfectly satisfied.	14.6318
"Next time you call," said she, "I hope we shall be more lucky."	33.9292
Widely
different was the effect of a second perusal.--How could she deny that
credit to his assertions, in one instance, which she had been obliged to
give in the other?--He declared himself to have been totally
unsuspicious of her sister's attachment;--and she could not help
remembering what Charlotte's opinion had always been.--Neither could she
deny the justice of his description of Jane.--She felt that Jane's
feelings, though fervent, were little displayed, and that there was a
constant complacency in her air and manner, not often united with great
sensibility.	56.6298
"I suspected as much," replied Elizabeth.	47.4768
To have his errors made public might ruin him for
ever.	120.7093
The good news quickly spread through the house; and with proportionate
speed through the neighbourhood.	94.4908
I know it to be impossible."	14.7095

Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to know
what they were talking of.	31.3502
"I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country for
my part, except the shops and public places.	78.5648
Mr. Bennet had very often wished, before this period of his life, that,
instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum, for
the better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived
him.	53.3773
III.	40.5396
She tried, however, to compose herself to
answer him with patience, when he should have done.	33.6009
He would scarcely be ten pounds a-year the loser, by the
hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket
allowance, and the continual presents in money, which passed to her,
through her mother's hands, Lydia's expences had been very little within
that sum.	90.1999
It was
generally evident whenever they met, that he _did_ admire her; and to
_her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference
which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a
way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it
was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane
united with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and a
uniform cheerfulness of manner, which would guard her from the
suspicions of the impertinent.	54.2626
I
assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an
agreeable and sensible young man, without having a wish beyond it.	53.4221
"My mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her spirits are greatly
shaken.	55.1165
_Too
much_, I am afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort
springs from a breach of promise, for I ought not to have mentioned the
subject?	53.6412
"But I was embarrassed."	42.3874
I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their
side, for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing, if she had
been well looked after.	48.7614
There was neither in figure nor face, any
likeness between the ladies.	83.4854
She is grown so brown and coarse!	54.0131
"Not as you represent it.	66.2665
"Very well--and this offer of marriage you have refused?"	73.9176
She was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real
state of her sister's spirits.	32.2073
The first half hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she
should suffer from the change of room; and she removed at his desire to
the other side of the fire-place, that she might be farther from the
door.	54.9728
There
can be no occasion for your going so soon.	29.8377
Kitty owned that she had rather stay at home.	35.0442
She was roused from her seat, and her reflections, by some one's
approach; and before she could strike into another path, she was
overtaken by Wickham.	61.9236
I enquired after their brother, of course.	56.1616
"With three younger sisters grown up," replied Elizabeth smiling, "your
Ladyship can hardly expect me to own it."	92.5818
She has two nieces
of her own.	35.2993
"Two offences of a very different nature, and by no means of equal
     magnitude, you last night laid to my charge.	68.8495
The very first
sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for
the winter, and concluded with her brother's regret at not having had
time to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left
the country.	53.2349
And is it really true?	52.7440
"Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality,
especially on Lydia's side, but nothing to give him any alarm.	48.8144
1.F.	279.5954
I would go and see her, if I could have the
carriage."	38.9900
However little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he contented
himself with coolly replying, that he perceived no other alteration than
her being rather tanned,--no miraculous consequence of travelling in the
summer.	74.4033
We
dressed up Chamberlayne in woman's clothes, on purpose to pass for a
lady,--only think what fun!	182.7786
"Your surprise could not be greater than _mine_ in being noticed by you.	60.2789
"You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy
were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr.	63.2429
Their brother is a pleasant gentleman-like
man--he is a great friend of Darcy's."	55.3489
"Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very often
do."	91.1259
Her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore to
invite him to sit by herself.	47.8064
certainly," cried his faithful assistant, "no one can be really
esteemed accomplished, who does not greatly surpass what is usually met
with.	82.5452
At that moment, she cared for no other.	55.2077
When have you been prevented by want of money from going
wherever you chose, or procuring any thing you had a fancy for?"	128.3027
"And what arts did he use to separate them?"	55.2160
Here was knowledge in which no one could
partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect
understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this
last incumbrance of mystery.	113.1342
The children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two
younger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their cousin
Jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and
sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every
way--teaching them, playing with them, and loving them.	99.7541
"Are they indeed?"	106.0836
"Insolent girl!"	388.9778
"Well, Lizzy," said Mrs. Bennet one day, "what is your opinion _now_ of
this sad business of Jane's?	57.5350
"My dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?"	33.4335
He addressed
himself directly to Miss Bennet, with a polite congratulation; Mr. Hurst
also made her a slight bow, and said he was "very glad;" but diffuseness
and warmth remained for Bingley's salutation.	45.1588
It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted
so in my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves
before anybody else.	85.6506
Mr.
Gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off.	47.8064
You know it is not
sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself."	38.0904
"Yes," replied Wickham;--"his estate there is a noble one.	49.8697
"This is not to be borne.	14.0053
Of what he has _particularly_ accused me I am ignorant; but
     of the truth of what I shall relate, I can summon more than one
     witness of undoubted veracity.	71.1722
Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.	49.6545
that my dear mother had more command over herself; she can have no
idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him.	77.4182
Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those
in the room.	42.4997
Elizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister to visit
her, the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was consequently
resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning.	66.7745
When they
had gained their own room, Jane taking out the letter, said,

"This is from Caroline Bingley; what it contains, has surprised me a
good deal.	77.1612
Jane was already so much recovered
as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening.	50.6023
Till I was in Kent, and saw
so much both of Mr. Darcy and his relation, Colonel Fitzwilliam, I was
ignorant of the truth myself.	38.4984
Oh!	7.8559
Bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations.	41.1569
Your
     father was gone, your uncle at home, and, as I said before, they
     had a great deal of talk together.	36.1024
All were struck with the stranger's air,
all wondered who he could be, and Kitty and Lydia, determined if
possible to find out, led the way across the street, under pretence of
wanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just gained
the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same
spot.	107.0747
But before I am run away with by my feelings on this
subject, perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for
marrying--and moreover for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of
selecting a wife, as I certainly did."	82.6832
The little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standing
on the steps of the house, as they entered the paddock; and when the
carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up their
faces, and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety of
capers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome.	64.1035
If he _had another_ motive, I am sure it would never
     disgrace him.	29.7476
Such I was, from eight to eight and twenty; and such I might
still have been but for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth!	134.9084
"I have been making the tour of the Park," he replied, "as I generally
do every year, and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage.	47.1387
Your ladyship wants Mr. Darcy to marry
your daughter; but would my giving you the wished-for promise, make
_their_ marriage at all more probable?	111.4105
"You can _now_ have nothing farther to say," she resentfully answered.	41.2688
See
paragraph 1.C below.	143.7123
"Upon my word," said her Ladyship, "you give your opinion very
decidedly for so young a person.--Pray, what is your age?"	77.5623
my sweetest Lizzy!	58.8385
"If I had been able," said she, "to carry my point of going to Brighton,
with all my family, _this_ would not have happened; but poor dear Lydia
had nobody to take care of her.	48.5736
Elizabeth's spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted Mr.
Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her.	52.4990
They had, therefore, many
acquaintance in common; and, though Wickham had been little there since
the death of Darcy's father, five years before, it was yet in his power
to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends, than she had
been in the way of procuring.	51.3012
Her reflections were
in general satisfactory.	75.1407
What is to become of us!	79.4642
"Money!	55.3684
cried he, with an air of awkward
gallantry; "and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express
authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of
being acceptable."	61.2549
"Yes, there can; for mine is totally different.--Will you hear it?"	118.9212
It was reasonable that he should feel
he had been wrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising
it; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement,
she could, perhaps, believe, that remaining partiality for her, might
assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be
materially concerned.	63.5323
"You look pale.	51.1870
I am not at all afraid of her dying.	17.6935
"She is a very fine-looking woman!	97.6951
Bennet."	46.2944
"His being so sure of succeeding, was wrong," said she; "and certainly
ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his
disappointment."	62.9003
But I hope you will not mind it: it is
all for Jane's sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking to
him, except just now and then.	36.0958
She then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make
inquiries on the same subject of Bingley.	53.2023
This was invitation enough.	51.3549
Their eyes
were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers,
and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed, or a really new muslin
in a shop window, could recal them.	85.8835
I do not think it
is very pretty; but I thought I might as well buy it as not.	37.1787
Thus much for my general
intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views
were directed to Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I
assure you there are many amiable young women.	77.0104
I always said it must be so, at last.	34.5387
Their sister's wedding day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her
probably more than she felt for herself.	57.9780
The two youngest of the family,
Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions;
their minds were more vacant than their sisters', and when nothing
better offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning
hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and however bare of news
the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some
from their aunt.	105.6009
In a few minutes
he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty; and, while
pretending to admire her work, said in a whisper, "Go to your father, he
wants you in the library."	43.0093
I had not an idea of it."	23.0245
Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious
part of each was when the post was expected.	73.2252
Her nose wants
character; there is nothing marked in its lines.	110.3123
My mother means well;
but she does not know, no one can know how much I suffer from what she
says.	63.3568
"Oh, no!"	60.2328
The principal
purport of his letter was to inform them, that Mr. Wickham had resolved
on quitting the Militia.	39.7452
Lady Catherine's great attentions to Mrs. Collins you
have been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust it does not appear
that your friend has drawn an unfortunate--but on this point it will be
as well to be silent.	77.7085
I roused, and
interested you, because I was so unlike _them_.	56.2576
This was his plan of amends--of atonement--for inheriting their father's
estate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and
suitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own
part.	106.6362
Her home and her housekeeping, her parish and her
poultry, and all their dependent concerns, had not yet lost their
charms.	68.8398
An union of a different tendency, and
precluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their
family.	47.0615
If there
were any one, that one could apply to, with a probability of gaining
such a clue as that, it might be of essential consequence.	61.0132
Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it.	39.5133
"Then," observed Elizabeth, "you must comprehend a great deal in your
idea of an accomplished woman."	45.8196
Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would have been
very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was
not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her
restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield.	62.1780

With such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes, did Lydia,
assisted by Kitty's hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her
companions all the way to Longbourn.	69.4545
Bingley of course returned with him to dinner;
and in the evening Mrs. Bennet's invention was again at work to get
every body away from him and her daughter.	82.5829
There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every
attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself.	53.8382
"You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner."	47.8686
Their other aunt also
visited them frequently, and always, as she said, with the design of
cheering and heartening them up, though as she never came without
reporting some fresh instance of Wickham's extravagance or irregularity,
she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found
them.	79.6540
how I laughed!	53.5529
I suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have
seen it in the papers.	27.6999
said Mrs. Bennet, more than
once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own.	51.7752
"I must ask whether you were surprised?"	54.7242
It is of all subjects my delight.	56.3261
Seriously, I would have you be on your guard.	83.7797
This
unfortunate affair will, I fear, prevent my sister's having the pleasure
of seeing you at Pemberley to-day."	47.6649
A single man of large fortune; four
or five thousand a year.	84.3868
"That is exactly what I should have supposed of you," said Elizabeth.	26.1605
"And what did she say?"	30.3671
Though she dared not depend upon the
consequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour.	41.3194
I believe him to be Lady Catherine's _nephew_.	18.6488
And to be kept back on _such_ a motive!--I think it
would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of
mind."	46.7748
"I should like it beyond any thing!"	27.3164
She was not of so ungovernable a
temper as Lydia, and, removed from the influence of Lydia's example, she
became, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less
ignorant, and less insipid.	68.4116
I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in
the gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your beaux
will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three, of
whom we shall deprive you."	91.0805
My sister, who is more than ten years my
     junior, was left to the guardianship of my mother's nephew, Colonel
     Fitzwilliam, and myself.	41.4043
She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a
proper situation for her daughter, and, without knowing or considering
what their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and
importance.	84.7793
There
is nothing he would not do for her."	21.4239
About the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready
for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in
confusion; and after listening a moment, she heard somebody running up
stairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her.	68.1803
"I can readily believe," answered he gravely, "that report may vary
greatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were
not to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to
fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either."	73.6991
She lost all concern for him in
finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous
gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the
reproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever
cause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified
and her preference secured at any time by their renewal.	91.5604
"_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room," said Mr.
Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.	35.2265
"She did indeed, Louisa.	35.7160
Miss Bennet's astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly
partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly
natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings.	103.5286
Lydia was Lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, and
fearless.	66.7742
Her ladyship received them
civilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so
acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact,
almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy,
much more than to any other person in the room.	54.1935
"I have said no such thing.	22.4900
It must be an amusing study."	28.1389
"Well, so much the better.	42.5594
The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants,
and all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had promised; and, as he
had likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by
her ladyship's desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish
nothing greater.--He carved, and ate, and praised with delighted
alacrity; and every dish was commended, first by him, and then by Sir
William, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son in law
said, in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear.	57.9956
Sir William, how can you tell such a story?--Do not you know
that Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?"	40.4629
"Yes, indeed; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of
the very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have made
him happy if they had.	68.9904
"We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire."	31.9866
And then when we came away it was such fun!	79.7468
I did not wink at you."	21.6913
"I am not likely to leave Kent for some time.	15.4557
Oh!	7.8559
The park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed
one of the gates into the ground.	66.8935
This is my advice.	29.7366
Lady Catherine seemed resigned.	29.5284
We were always encouraged to
read, and had all the masters that were necessary.	62.2770
"You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound.	51.9993
"And of this place," thought she, "I might have been mistress!	45.5676
When they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself as
much as possible against Mr. Darcy, chose for her employment the
examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her
being in Kent.	52.7922
Yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no
compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing
how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the admiration of her
former lover.	118.8482
And is
_such_ a girl to be my nephew's sister?	37.2255
She comes to us to-day.	27.7789
During dinner, Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants
were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with his
guest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to
shine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness.	62.3243
As the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile
across the park.--Every park has its beauty and its prospects; and
Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such
raptures as Mr. Collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but
slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the
house, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally
cost Sir Lewis De Bourgh.	70.4503
As soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits;
or in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects that
must deaden them more.	67.9369
How could he spare half ten
thousand pounds?"	43.3386
She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on
the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect.	38.5835
But she had never felt so
strongly as now, the disadvantages which must attend the children of so
unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils
arising from so ill-judged a direction of talents; talents which rightly
used, might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters,
even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.	87.9336
The whole family in short
were properly overjoyed on the occasion.	50.4447
I have been a disappointed man, and
my spirits will not bear solitude.	30.5410
Hope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the rest of
the letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the
writer, that could give her any comfort.	70.2878
It does not often happen
that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of
independent fortune to think no more of a girl, whom he was violently in
love with only a few days before."	45.0992
I am sorry to say it of
them, but so it is.	32.5328
To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it had
been asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by his
repeating it.	65.1170
Elizabeth now began to revive.	51.1638
"It may perhaps be pleasant," replied Charlotte, "to be able to impose
on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be
so very guarded.	51.7887
"She is a great deal too ill to be
moved.	28.9969
"Indeed," replied Elizabeth, "I am heartily sorry for him; but he has
other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me.	42.7215
He was then, he said, on his way to Longbourn on
purpose to inquire after her.	41.3647
"These are heavy misfortunes," replied Elizabeth.	45.0248
I expected
you to stay two months.	49.2973
The officers will find
women better worth their notice.	93.6107
His own
     father did not long survive mine, and within half a year from these
     events, Mr. Wickham wrote to inform me that, having finally
     resolved against taking orders, he hoped I should not think it
     unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary
     advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he could not be
     benefited.	67.9560
it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously
so strong an affection.	86.9314
We all love to
instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing.	90.3131
He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth
his while.	98.7701
It was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for
Longbourn, before she told her sister of Mr. Darcy's proposals.	42.3704
The period of expectation was now doubled.	50.6783
This was a sad omen of what her mother's behaviour to the gentleman
himself might be; and Elizabeth found, that though in the certain
possession of his warmest affection, and secure of her relations'
consent, there was still something to be wished for.	59.8988
Bingley was all grateful
pleasure, and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of
waiting on her, after his return from London, whither he was obliged to
go the next day for a short time.	42.8216
"I do not think we were speaking at all.	14.4182
And as I come back, I can call on
Lady Lucas and Mrs. Long.	39.9955
"In point of composition," said Mary, "his letter does not seem
defective.	62.4263
If your abhorrence of
     _me_ should make _my_ assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented
     by the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there may
     be the possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour to find
     some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course
     of the morning.	43.3634
These are conditions, which,
     considering every thing, I had no hesitation in complying with, as
     far as I thought myself privileged, for you.	50.9037
What are you telling Miss Bennet?	49.2878
I do assure you that my intimacy has not
yet taught me _that_.	61.0954
are quite well."	62.1593
CHAPTER XXI.	15.1432
"I did not think you would;--and that being the case, I cannot consider
your situation with much compassion."	45.6386
"You have.	24.1008
"If we thought alike of Miss Bingley," replied Jane, "your
representation of all this, might make me quite easy.	41.7492
We now come to the point.	39.1151
Jane, who was not so light, nor so much in the habit of running as
Elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for breath,
came up with him, and eagerly cried out,

"Oh, Papa, what news?	66.0759
Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, and
had left her four thousand pounds.	30.2668
It
was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so
unsuitable a match.	38.3561
"Yes, Ma'am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him--just
as affable to the poor."	46.6091
I am always glad to get a young person well placed out.	56.8554
The time fixed for the beginning of their Northern tour was now fast
approaching; and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter
arrived from Mrs. Gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and
curtailed its extent.	76.3594
She approached, and saw
the likeness of Mr. Wickham suspended, amongst several other miniatures,
over the mantle-piece.	88.3204
It was a large, handsome, stone
building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of high
woody hills;--and in front, a stream of some natural importance was
swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance.	111.7699
I am going to-morrow
where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality, who has
neither manner nor sense to recommend him.	40.5365
He was on one side of her mother.	15.3637
Well, he is a
very undeserving young man--and I do not suppose there is the least
chance in the world of her ever getting him now.	39.8594
and her calling here was prodigiously
civil!	110.7009
You may depend upon my seeking no further."	36.8916
On such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her
power, by running away.	34.2724
She did not fear her father's opposition, but he was going to
be made unhappy, and that it should be through her means, that _she_,
his favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be
filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her, was a wretched
reflection, and she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared again, when,
looking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile.	56.2525
They
had all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister.	53.9964
no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so
full of both.	89.7408
"Take care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment."	127.9336
Elizabeth, equally
next to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course.	109.9468
my dear brother," replied Mrs. Bennet, "that is exactly what I
could most wish for.	31.0352
"I see your design, Bingley," said his friend.--"You dislike an
argument, and want to silence this."	49.4158
One came from her books, and the other from her
toilette.	51.3642
Under such circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof
     against the temptation of immediate relief.	50.5263
I depend on you for that."	47.6498
he is the handsomest young man that
ever was seen!"	50.6803
He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely
agreeable, and to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly
with a large party.	54.7968
Well, my comfort is, I am sure
Jane will die of a broken heart, and then he will be sorry for what he
has done."	47.9288
"We have heard only once.	39.2096
And she rose as she spoke.	30.4199
"I should take him, even on _my_ slight acquaintance, to be an
ill-tempered man."	57.0700
The
possibility of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing the place, instantly
occurred.	65.2475
It would surely be much
more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the
day."	80.4012
yes," said Elizabeth drily--"Mr. Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr.
Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him."	65.5797
My friend has an excellent understanding--though
I am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr. Collins as the wisest
thing she ever did.	94.8111
The horses
were post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who
preceded it, were familiar to them.	85.5614
Miss Bingley warmly
resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her
brother for talking such nonsense.	100.3310
In pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his
cousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton.	109.4056
His
friend had left him that morning for London, but was to return home in
ten days time.	67.9250
Elizabeth found that nothing was
beneath this great Lady's attention, which could furnish her with an
occasion of dictating to others.	59.7899
Into _one_ house in this
neighbourhood, they shall never have admittance.	54.5604
She expected every
moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room.	69.6077
It had not been very great; he had lost every point;
but when Mrs. Philips began to express her concern thereupon, he assured
her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance,
that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged she would not
make herself uneasy.	47.9660
After amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus explained.	101.4253
"Oh, well!	32.8000
"That is right.--You could not have started a more happy idea, since you
will not take comfort in mine.	42.8077
"I assure you, Madam," he replied, "that she does not need such advice.	26.2616
If
the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other, or
ever so similar before-hand, it does not advance their felicity in the
least.	65.4581
"Mr.	24.5133
The invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they joined
the party in Lady Catherine's drawing-room.	52.6497
The present unhappy state of the family, rendered any other excuse for
the lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore, could be
fairly conjectured from _that_, though Elizabeth, who was by this time
tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings, was perfectly aware,
that, had she known nothing of Darcy, she could have borne the dread of
Lydia's infamy somewhat better.	58.4681
She looked at her father to entreat his
interference, lest Mary should be singing all night.	57.0230
"And _that_ I suppose is one of your sisters."	26.6704
_My_
father began life in the profession which your uncle, Mr. Philips,
appears to do so much credit to--but he gave up every thing to be of use
to the late Mr. Darcy, and devoted all his time to the care of the
Pemberley property.	65.5344
"He brought it with him for us to see."	67.4968
There was
another reason too for her opposition.	47.4266
"I do, I do like him," she replied, with tears in her eyes, "I love him.	33.0649
Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go,
merely on that account, for in general you know they visit no new
comers.	67.4675
Before any answer could arrive from Mr. Collins, or any congratulations
to Elizabeth, from his wife, the Longbourn family heard that the
Collinses were come themselves to Lucas lodge.	70.0414
cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a moment.	29.0186
"How strange this is!	57.2928
It was more
than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such
attention.	51.2724
Can I speak plainer?	36.2042
She could not help frequently
glancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what
she dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was
convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her.	54.3513
She
concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally
fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no
chance of it.	61.0937
They were natural and just.	76.8104
After
pausing on this point a considerable while, she once more continued to
read.	96.9740
Darcy!--My father's opinion of me does
me the greatest honour; and I should be miserable to forfeit it.	81.7303
CHAPTER I.


Elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of
Pemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned
in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.	77.0160
Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.	44.1379
He had never before supposed
that, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would be
done with so little inconvenience to himself, as by the present
arrangement.	36.9254
Every day added something to their knowledge of the
officers' names and connections.	95.0251
A
most delightful place!--Excellent Parsonage House!	111.4972
"And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?"	46.9854
My feelings in every respect
forbid it.	75.0966
But there was much to be talked of, in marrying her; and the
good-natured wishes for her well-doing, which had proceeded before, from
all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton, lost but little of their spirit
in this change of circumstances, because with such an husband, her
misery was considered certain.	84.5033
Do not consider me now as an elegant
female intending to plague you, but as a rational creature speaking the
truth from her heart."	72.6585
Imprudent as a marriage between Mr. Wickham and our poor Lydia
     would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place, for
     there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to Scotland.	61.4551
CHAPTER XIII.	15.1432
"Yes.	21.2462
In the intervals of her discourse with
Mrs. Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and
Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew
the least, and who she observed to Mrs. Collins, was a very genteel,
pretty kind of girl.	61.8092
Your daughter
Elizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet, after
her elder sister has resigned it, and the chosen partner of her fate,
may be reasonably looked up to, as one of the most illustrious
personages in this land."	87.6108
Those that best pleased her, as
placing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable.	129.2159
my dear, dear Jane, I am so
happy!	11.5452
Adieu to disappointment and spleen.	149.2240
She has been doing
every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject, to give
greater--what shall I call it?	36.8004
And I do not think it of light importance
that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every
body, especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment.	65.5635
"My dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of
their father and mother.--When they get to our age I dare say they will
not think about officers any more than we do.	48.9015
"Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us as
wished to learn, never wanted the means.	102.9849
"How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give, and that
I should be so reasonable as to admit it!	35.5915
In this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away.	60.8177
"From Mr. Collins!	24.7170
added Elizabeth; "safe from a connection
imprudent as to fortune."	90.0280
You will find her manners beyond any
thing I can describe; and your wit and vivacity I think must be
acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect
which her rank will inevitably excite.	68.4829
"After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last
night, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed what she
felt on the occasion; when it became apparent, that on the score of some
family objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give her
consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match.	61.2603
To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin,
and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine
their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantle-piece, the
interval of waiting appeared very long.	56.0955
The respect created by the conviction of his
valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some
time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings; and it was now heightened
into somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony so highly in his
favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light,
which yesterday had produced.	84.7552
Her aunt assured her that she was; and Elizabeth having thanked her for
the kindness of her hints, they parted; a wonderful instance of advice
being given on such a point, without being resented.	59.5328
"While I can have my mornings to myself," said she, "it is enough.--I
think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements.	68.9664
We do not suffer by _accident_.	30.1059
Very
frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and
Lydia, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such
hard-heartedness in any of the family.	102.8967
And
what do you think she said besides?	80.6343
He
     meant to resign his commission immediately; and as to his future
     situation, he could conjecture very little about it.	78.3149
said he, smiling.	17.1955
"A great deal of good management, depend upon it.	30.0411
"Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you.	34.3587
"_That_ is a failing indeed!"	41.5640
"Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention
as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?"	129.6450
To Rosings he then
hastened to console Lady Catherine, and her daughter; and on his return,
brought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her Ladyship,
importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of
having them all to dine with her.	44.6518
Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared for an
interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with
calmness, if he really intended to meet them.	55.7017
His sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own; but
though he was now established only as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no
means unwilling to preside at his table, nor was Mrs. Hurst, who had
married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider
his house as her home when it suited her.	61.9957
Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!)	220.9599
And
when we _do_ return, it shall not be like other travellers, without
being able to give one accurate idea of any thing.	47.7016
"Indeed I have, Sir," was her answer.	34.0397
In as short a time as Mr. Collins's long speeches would allow, every
thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as they
entered the house, he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was
to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must be
waved for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his
happiness.	57.2075
I can hardly write for
     laughing.	22.4220
Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to
Colonel Fitzwilliam, "Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of
me, and teach you not to believe a word I say.	55.4110
A few days after this visit, Mr. Bingley called again, and alone.	40.7549
Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment
of her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many
of the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on
the business.	61.2368
"_You_ want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."	20.9917
Lydia gaped as he opened the volume, and
before he had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three pages, she
interrupted him with,

"Do you know, mama, that my uncle Philips talks of turning away Richard,
and if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him.	75.0783
The vicious propensities--the
     want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge
     of his best friend, could not escape the observation of a young man
     of nearly the same age with himself, and who had opportunities of
     seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr. Darcy could not have.	47.1993
Younger sons cannot marry
where they like."	113.6843
Bingley."	23.7899
"I am the less surprised at what has happened," replied Sir William,
"from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which
my situation in life has allowed me to acquire.	72.2903
and
yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and
ridicule."	58.0328
"I desire you will do no such thing.	36.9895
Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as given in
compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered by
receiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself, instead of a
ceremonious card.	48.0437
I know we dine with four and twenty families."	94.4758
We are persuaded that he has pledged himself
to assist Mr. Wickham with money."	50.7472
"We were born in the same parish, within the same park, the greatest
part of our youth was passed together; inmates of the same house,
sharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care.	57.9619
Oh, sister!	34.6394
For
though elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the
contrary, he was all attention to every body.	46.5090
"What is it you mean?"	28.5898
She tried to
recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of
integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of Mr.
Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for those
casual errors, under which she would endeavour to class, what Mr. Darcy
had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance.	76.1164
On the contrary she was as much disposed to
complain of it as her husband.--It was very strange that he should come
to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenient
and exceedingly troublesome.--She hated having visitors in the house
while her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the
most disagreeable.	81.7915
Every body was surprised; and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment,
turned silently away.	53.2199
He was not seated by her; perhaps that was the reason of his silence;
but it had not been so in Derbyshire.	37.4176
What a meeting for her, when she
first sees my aunt!"	70.3353
Mr.
Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured
with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless.	67.3423
That such a
consequence as _this_ should ensue, you may easily believe was far
enough from my thoughts."	104.1185
On applying to see the place, they were admitted into the
hall; and Elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to
wonder at her being where she was.	42.3288
Without allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely knowing
what she felt, Elizabeth on finishing this letter, instantly seized the
other, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read as follows: it
had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first.	64.4705
It was exactly a scene, and exactly among people,
where he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go.	51.6368
"And how impossible in others!"	124.3511
Elizabeth made no
answer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which
she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and
reading in her neighbours' looks their equal amazement in beholding it.	57.8861
But it ended in
nothing, and I will not be sent on a fool's errand again."	73.7351
If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.	61.9739
That the wish of giving happiness to you, might add force to the other
inducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to deny.	53.5137
"Yes, my youngest is not sixteen.	30.0135
Her affections had been continually
fluctuating, but never without an object.	61.6370
The death
     of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this.	32.4881
"It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my lady, I dare say; but I
assure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas's."	30.8201
He is gone to my father already.	26.4005
She was more alive to the disgrace, which the want of new
clothes must reflect on her daughter's nuptials, than to any sense of
shame at her eloping and living with Wickham, a fortnight before they
took place.	56.0331
But how came you to tell us that he was so
disagreeable?"	52.2486
These recollections will not do at
all.	29.5590
He stood by her, however, for
some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady's whispering
to Elizabeth again, he walked away.	44.2245
When the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs. Bennet was mindful of her
intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at
Longbourn in a few days time.	34.6264
Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he
suddenly addressed her with,

"I hope Mr. Bingley will like it Lizzy."	114.8311
Let Wickham
be _your_ man.	81.3071
I really do not think Georgiana
Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the
affection she inspires in Louisa and myself, is heightened into
something still more interesting, from the hope we dare to entertain of
her being hereafter our sister.	101.5505
She knew not how to
support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an
hour.	33.8719
Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of
the moment, been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted with their fears for
her sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper
termination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its
unfavourable beginning, from all those who were not immediately on the
spot.	77.3204
Why should they try to influence him?	44.9194
my dear father, can you
suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever
they are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the
disgrace?"	44.7831
They crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of
the scene; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and
the valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the
stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered
it.	98.3573
The coach, therefore, took them the first stage of their
journey, and brought its master back to Longbourn.	74.5521
Mr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them
on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by
her communication.	50.2190
"Well, Lizzy," continued her mother soon afterwards, "and so the
Collinses live very comfortable, do they?	71.1926
Astonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her.	93.3248
That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was
another very welcome surprise; for his chief wish at present, was to
have as little trouble in the business as possible.	52.0351
Any place would do, of about three or four
     hundred a year; but, however, do not speak to Mr. Darcy about it,
     if you had rather not.	59.3736
Hear me in silence.	58.1723
"You begin to comprehend me, do you?"	31.4181
Their first subject was her
sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to
her minute enquiries, that though Jane always struggled to support her
spirits, there were periods of dejection.	81.6761
Neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of
their Lambton friends, that could materially lessen its weight.	67.1508
She will be down in a moment I dare say."	18.8720
"He must be an oddity, I think," said she.	23.6661
--A
short pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again.	51.7738
Kitty, run down and order the carriage.	48.8216
She knew but little
of their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness
which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time
after receiving his explanatory letter.	53.8906
"There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to
give me no hope from law.	50.6054
"When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no reason, I
suppose, to believe them fond of each other."	32.2609
Give me farther particulars.	68.1048
The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart; and by a
manoeuvre of Mrs. Bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of
an hour after every body else was gone, which gave them time to see how
heartily they were wished away by some of the family.	60.4309
It was all conjecture."	22.1349
Miss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and, though
little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance
womanly and graceful.	82.8150
Tell him what a dreadful state I am in,--that I am frightened
out of my wits; and have such tremblings, such flutterings, all over me,
such spasms in my side, and pains in my head, and such beatings at
heart, that I can get no rest by night nor by day.	103.9396
But Mr. Gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours
in the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well in
her hopes as her fears; and, after talking with her in this manner till
dinner was on table, they left her to vent all her feelings on the
housekeeper, who attended, in the absence of her daughters.	59.2520
The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently
characteristic.	92.4109
Darcy shook his head in silent acquiesence.	40.6384
It is too long ago.	27.2029
The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and
roads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine's behaviour was most
friendly and obliging.	38.4215
She could think only of her letter.	32.4907
_I_ only
want to think _you_ perfect, and you set yourself against it.	55.6431
"He has made me so happy," said she, one evening, "by telling me, that
he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring!	37.7934
But self, though it would intrude, could not engross her.	66.8050
"Exceedingly well.	231.9556
You blamed me for coming?"	50.0337
The tumult of Elizabeth's mind was allayed by this conversation.	50.6485
As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the
family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies moved
for the night; and Mrs. Bennet with great politeness and cordiality said
how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again, whenever his
other engagements might allow him to visit them.	61.2813
"Can such abominable pride as his, have ever done him good?"	99.4544
It would vex me, indeed, to see you again
the dupe of Miss Bingley's pretended regard."	44.2542
You refuse to obey the
claims of duty, honour, and gratitude.	66.9901
She burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could
not speak another word.	51.7623
But she would not be secure.	14.7284

Elizabeth loved absurdities, but she had
known Sir William's too long.	50.5096

Printed for T. Egerton,
Military Library, Whitehall.	29.2040
"Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination," said Elizabeth.	48.0813
"We will be down as soon as we can," said Jane; "but I dare say Kitty is
forwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs half an hour ago."	51.0424
But Jane could think with certainty on only one point,--that Mr.
Bingley, if he _had been_ imposed on, would have much to suffer when the
affair became public.	53.0440
Perhaps I
did not always love him so well as I do now.	45.8324
"I have, Sir."	17.8324
Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the
man and the match were quite good enough for _her_, the worth of each
was eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield.	74.2847
said she, "I heard you before; but I could not immediately
determine what to say in reply.	37.3256
Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely
allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the
ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise.	62.3363
To be fond of
dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively
hopes of Mr. Bingley's heart were entertained.	59.7808
"Aye--because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and he
could not help answering her;--but she said he seemed very angry at
being spoke to."	64.4946
To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and
shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well
aware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds
in the 4 per cents.	65.2423
Why could not he keep on quarrelling with you, as his father
did before him?"	62.2782
Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of
passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too
much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas
was his neighbour, till Sir William thus began.	55.7097
That she should receive an offer of
marriage from Mr. Darcy!	27.9700
"It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of to yours."	60.8301
"What will be his surprise," thought
she, "when he knows who they are!	77.5847
His
attachment to Rosings, certainly increases."	107.1175
as we went along, Kitty and me drew up all the blinds, and pretended
there was nobody in the coach; and I should have gone so all the way, if
Kitty had not been sick; and when we got to the George, I do think we
behaved very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest
cold luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have
treated you too.	57.4276
"There is a gentleman with him, mamma," said Kitty; "who can it be?"	41.1996
On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn; and the two,
who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality as
sportsmen, were in very good time.	68.8206
"But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another
opportunity."	35.8088
But every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she had
believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent, as to
render Mr. Darcy's conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a
turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole.	70.9554
Such relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice
of what might be called economy in her own private expences, she
frequently sent them.	49.1293
We must not expect a lively young man
to be always so guarded and circumspect.	47.6572
It is impossible that he should still love
me."	41.6724
He then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of
having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself.	52.9285
He
smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.	59.3306
I knew how it
would be.	15.4484
At length, however, the question was
asked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while Mrs. Reynolds
replied, that he was, adding, "but we expect him to-morrow, with a
large party of friends."	40.7151
At length, she spoke again.	30.7260
His name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece;
and the kind of half-expectation which Mrs. Gardiner had formed, of
their being followed by a letter from him, had ended in nothing.	54.5837
But you are always giving _her_ the
preference."	51.8114
The business of her life was to get her
daughters married; its solace was visiting and news.	92.4424
Your conduct would be quite as
dependant on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were
mounting your horse, a friend were to say, 'Bingley, you had better stay
till next week,' you would probably do it, you would probably not
go--and, at another word, might stay a month."	82.6008
She examined into their employments, looked at their work,
and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement
of the furniture, or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she
accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding
out that Mrs. Collins's joints of meat were too large for her family.	77.3744
She
studied every sentence: and her feelings towards its writer were at
times widely different.	87.8060
My dear Hill, have you
heard the good news?	36.5541
"Your humility, Mr. Bingley," said Elizabeth, "must disarm reproof."	35.6173
What Wickham had said of the living
was fresh in her memory, and as she recalled his very words, it was
impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the
other; and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did
not err.	55.3599
Reflection must be
reserved for solitary hours; whenever she was alone, she gave way to it
as the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a solitary walk,
in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant
recollections.	94.2699
I should be sorry, you know,
to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire."	24.5916
The satisfaction of
prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to be
her husband, might then have rested in its proper place.	61.0066
It is only that he is blessed with
greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally
pleasing than any other man."	43.4609
Mr. Gardiner, whose manners were easy and pleasant, encouraged her
communicativeness by his questions and remarks; Mrs. Reynolds, either
from pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her
master and his sister.	82.9602
Mr. Darcy's behaviour astonished and vexed her.	40.2542
After a slight preparation
for good news, the letter was read aloud.	68.4324
"I often think," said she, "that there is nothing so bad as parting with
one's friends.	51.3417
Teaze him--laugh at
him.--Intimate as you are, you must know how it is to be done."	52.1763
With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and otherwise
diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton, sometimes dirty and
sometimes cold, did January and February pass away.	172.6565
Mr.	24.5133
But who could have foreseen such an attention as this?	44.2647
And do you
really love him quite well enough?	63.9180
"Probably not;--but Mr. Darcy can please where he chuses.	101.3189
Well, Colonel
Fitzwilliam, what do I play next?	46.8568
Is not he a charming man?	58.0097
"You certainly do," she replied with a smile; "but it does not follow
that the interruption must be unwelcome."	53.2804
"I cannot pretend to be sorry," said Wickham, after a short
interruption, "that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond
their deserts; but with _him_ I believe it does not often happen.	45.3572
"It must be something particular, to take him there at this
time of year."	48.2274
It was only said, 'Lately,
George Wickham, Esq.	42.5044
Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with perfect
indifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter, and
her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the
next morning to London.	36.6022
And tell my dear
Lydia, not to give any directions about her clothes, till she has seen
me, for she does not know which are the best warehouses.	53.5621
No one but Mrs. Bennet, regretted that their stay would be so short; and
she made the most of the time, by visiting about with her daughter, and
having very frequent parties at home.	66.7044
He heard her attentively, and then said,

"Lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public
place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so little
expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present
circumstances."	63.6787
Mr. Darcy!	13.7407
Mr. Collins was eloquent in her praise.	28.5715
"He did not talk to me of his own arts," said Fitzwilliam smiling.	23.6962
Jane's delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to
Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was glad of
it;--till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any
satisfaction, she had rather be without a confidante.	93.2575
CHAPTER XVI.	15.1432
I see
nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr.	49.8272
"Aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if I had
known your mother, I should have advised her most strenuously to engage
one.	82.0413
Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to
Meryton.	26.1916
It is highly improper.	24.3763
She saw him start at this, but he said nothing, and she continued,

"You could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way
that would have tempted me to accept it."	39.3715
What a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go."	47.7796
The letter was to this
effect:

     "MY DEAR LIZZY,

     "I wish you joy.	25.1862
The rest of the evening brought her little amusement.	37.2100
I thought I should have died.	21.5302
Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.	45.9020
"I am
sorry it went off.	25.6484
Lydia was exceedingly fond of him.	21.0138
Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told that he
need not stay.	30.4024
But
     last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice.	91.3689
"It
would be nothing; I could see him with perfect indifference, but I can
hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of.	37.8637
I shall like it of all
things.	34.7096
The housekeeper came; a respectable-looking, elderly woman, much less
fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her.	70.7663
PRIDE AND PREJUDICE:

A Novel.	54.6230
"You shall hear then--but prepare yourself for something very dreadful.	132.4117
In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined
and unvarying society."	106.7705
"You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him."	62.3130
Their visitors staid with them above half an hour, and when they arose
to depart, Mr. Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing
their wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, and Miss Bennet, to dinner
at Pemberley, before they left the country.	40.2237
You taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most
advantageous.	93.3476
With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own opinion
continued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry.	67.0146
Don't think me angry, however, for I only mean to let you know,
     that I had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on _your_
     side.	48.6845
Darcy."	35.1269
Three daughters married!	90.7428
I was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride
and conceit.	78.7655
"The garden in which stands my humble abode, is separated only by a lane
from Rosings Park, her ladyship's residence."	80.3061
With respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held
there in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns, with the
son of his patron, were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well known
fact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he had left many debts behind
him, which Mr. Darcy afterwards discharged.	77.3053
Elizabeth
smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.	36.9084
"For heaven's sake, madam, speak lower.--What advantage can it be to you
to offend Mr.	93.1656
It
was an union that must have been to the advantage of both; by her ease
and liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved,
and from his judgment, information, and knowledge of the world, she must
have received benefit of greater importance.	45.1546
A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to
Elizabeth; but at last on Mrs. Bennet's leaving them together, after a
longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master, she could
not help saying,

"Oh!	61.0600
We have heard nothing from town."	26.9578
He was growing quite
inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her.	42.1357
"Yes, she did."	17.4940
There will not be the smallest occasion for your coming
     to town again; therefore, stay quietly at Longbourn, and depend on
     my diligence and care.	67.1978
After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her why she
was so thoughtful.	109.2175
"So much the better.	37.4188
And so, is it quite certain he is coming?"	69.8809
Mrs. Philips was always glad to see her nieces, and the two eldest, from
their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and she was eagerly
expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as their own
carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing about, if
she had not happened to see Mr. Jones's shop boy in the street, who had
told her that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield
because the Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility was claimed
towards Mr. Collins by Jane's introduction of him.	56.0245
As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned
her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr. Bingley, and the
train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to,
made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane.	76.1584
Oh, no."	47.0472
Nay, when I read a letter of his, I cannot help giving
him the preference even over Wickham, much as I value the impudence and
hypocrisy of my son-in-law.	70.3412
Dearest Lizzy, I hardly know what I would
     write, but I have bad news for you, and it cannot be delayed.	39.0556
They must all go to Brighton.	26.8460
His character is thereby complete."	86.2371
"And your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate conviction to
him."	44.1878
"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into
the neighbourhood."	39.1381
She is a great
reader and has no pleasure in anything else."	44.7440
But we are none
of us consistent; and in his behaviour to me, there were stronger
impulses even than pride."	71.9471
I longed to
know whether he would be married in his blue coat.	35.0132
I am the happiest creature in
     the world.	22.4070
He begins with
congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of
which it seems he has been told, by some of the good-natured, gossiping
Lucases.	71.6252
Elizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing more,
and down they ran into the dining-room, which fronted the lane, in quest
of this wonder; it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the
garden gate.	69.0860
You forced me into visiting him last year, and promised if I
went to see him, he should marry one of my daughters.	46.5024
Bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier
girls in his life; every body had been most kind and attentive to him,
there had been no formality, no stiffness, he had soon felt acquainted
with all the room; and as to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel
more beautiful.	56.1048
The next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a quarter
of an hour's tête-à-tête with Mrs. Bennet before breakfast, a
conversation beginning with his parsonage-house, and leading naturally
to the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress for it might be found at
Longbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general
encouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on.--"As to
her _younger_ daughters she could not take upon her to say--she could
not positively answer--but she did not _know_ of any prepossession;--her
_eldest_ daughter, she must just mention--she felt it incumbent on her
to hint, was likely to be very soon engaged."	68.3496
Mr. Collins's triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete.	34.6446
But of course she did not mention my name to you."	37.7368
"And men take care that they should."	111.7635
Sir William only smiled.	21.3580
Bingley will not be detained in London by
them."	38.6180
"Very well.	27.8077
"As often as I can.	33.2641
But it was not to be.	13.0639
You supposed more than
     really existed.	60.7583
Accept my thanks for
the compliment you are paying me.	168.3729
With a triumphant smile, they were told, that it was ten
miles round.	45.7215
I dare say the
lace upon Mrs. Hurst's gown----"

Here she was interrupted again.	59.9025
"We
can all plague and punish one another.	120.5125
"They have both," said she, "been deceived, I dare say, in some way or
other, of which we can form no idea.	53.3733
Must it be so?"	62.9332
Colonel Forster will, I dare say, do every
thing in his power to satisfy us on this head.	40.4385
It needed all
Jane's steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable
tranquillity.	92.0563
"Perhaps," said Darcy, "I should have judged better, had I sought an
introduction, but I am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers."	50.4845
I wish I could say, for the sake of her family, that the accomplishment
of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children,
produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible, amiable,
well-informed woman for the rest of her life; though perhaps it was
lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic felicity in
so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous and
invariably silly.	64.5417
His wish of introducing his sister to her, was a compliment of
the highest kind.	52.6934
The communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was
said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on
Jane; and till the morrow, their going was deferred.	117.1508
Mrs. Bennet wished
to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of
her younger girls, and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him.	38.3776
But do not imagine
that he is always here so often.	32.3892
This he considered sufficient encouragement,
and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her,
immediately followed.	74.9974
We can all
_begin_ freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are
very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without
encouragement.	83.6562
She saw all the glories of the camp; its tents
stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young
and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and to complete the view, she
saw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six
officers at once.	100.4121
But it is all, all too late now."	54.9049
With an air of indifference he soon afterwards added, "How long did you
say that he was at Rosings?"	43.0392
If I had ever learnt, I
should have been a great proficient.	23.0450
Charlotte herself was tolerably composed.	176.9125
It was not till the afternoon, when he joined them at tea, that
Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on her briefly
expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured, he replied, "Say
nothing of that.	51.8036
*       *       *       *       *

Mr. Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother.	23.9211
There was not much in the
question, nor in the preceding remark, but there was a look and a manner
which gave them meaning.	40.6739
I told my sister Philips so the other day.	44.4347
Elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease
with which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so many
previous months of suspense and vexation.	59.1605
"Very much."	43.1468
While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether
she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr. Darcy, by the
feelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but
a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to
regret that he came.	65.1321
He had by that time reached it also, and holding out a letter,
which she instinctively took, said with a look of haughty composure, "I
have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you.	52.8551
But you do not know _all_.	14.1526
What will Wickham say?	20.2255
There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at
the will of others.	58.1374
At length Darcy spoke, and in a
constrained manner said,

"Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his
_making_ friends--whether he may be equally capable of _retaining_ them,
is less certain."	58.0343
But there is one
of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I
dare say, very agreeable.	42.5888
"But you--How are you?"	42.8908
No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her
triumph.	46.2566
The account of his connection with the Pemberley family, was exactly
what he had related himself; and the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy,
though she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his
own words.	45.9311
But _your_ arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation,
have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family.	79.4821
One
enjoyment was certain--that of suitableness as companions; a
suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear
inconveniences--cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure--and affection
and intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there were
disappointments abroad.	132.7257
But, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely
they should have opposed their brother's.	58.3819
Nor was it under many, many minutes, that
she could comprehend what she heard; though not in general backward to
credit what was for the advantage of her family, or that came in the
shape of a lover to any of them.	75.3623
But I think Mr. Darcy improves on acquaintance."	24.4781
My dear aunt, how could you think of it?	19.3596
"When I consider," she added, in a yet
more agitated voice, "that _I_ might have prevented it!--_I_ who knew
what he was.	54.1750
He came to tell Mr. Gardiner that
     he had found out where your sister and Mr. Wickham were, and that
     he had seen and talked with them both, Wickham repeatedly, Lydia
     once.	55.2047
"My dear Mr. Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that
Netherfield Park is let at last?"	47.2932

She had not at first thought very seriously of
going thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan,
and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure
as well as greater certainty.	68.0537
It would look odd to be
entirely silent for half an hour together, and yet for the advantage of
_some_, conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the
trouble of saying as little as possible."	50.8102
He has given in all his debts; I hope
     at least he has not deceived us.	43.8570
Not one party, or scheme, or any thing.	53.4395
For what do we
live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our
turn?"	66.9334
"You have a house in town, I conclude?"	25.3866
Yet now I must believe you," cried
Jane.	56.1481
She had even
learnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted her,
an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary.	98.6942
CHAPTER XXIII.	15.1432
Elizabeth could not but be pleased,
could not but triumph.	47.0571
Wickham indeed had gone to her, on their first arrival in
     London, and had she been able to receive them into her house, they
     would have taken up their abode with her.	44.2454
Mr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was
rather offended; and therefore checked her laugh.	50.2233
"Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary.	36.1565
She shared in their attendance on Mrs. Bennet, and was a
great comfort to them, in their hours of freedom.	48.6787
But Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort
for it, was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect
of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished
her all imaginable happiness.	51.0622
I will not tell you what it is.	17.3448
Mr. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast.	28.1596
It would have suited
me in every respect."	34.6306
There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.	49.2909
said her mother.	16.1312
Such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through
Longbourn-house.	96.3734
Elizabeth had mentioned her
name to her mother, on her ladyship's entrance, though no request of
introduction had been made.	45.2102
You are
not well enough;--you cannot go yourself."	22.9710
But I have always observed, that they who are
good-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and he
was always the sweetest-tempered, most generous-hearted, boy in the
world."	79.0429
If you, my dear
father, will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and
of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of
her life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment.	40.7437
"This is
wholly unexpected.	27.0546
It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment,
from which she had been so wholly free at first.	41.4233
"It shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing," said
Bingley.	41.9640
Mr. Wickham began the subject himself.	28.1497
"This is quite shocking!--He deserves to be publicly disgraced."	69.4019
They would doubtless be congenial with
the generality of female minds.	54.6454
Mr. Collins might never make the offer, and
till he did, it was useless to quarrel about him.	42.6710
But the gloom of Lydia's prospect was shortly cleared away; for she
received an invitation from Mrs. Forster, the wife of the Colonel of the
regiment, to accompany her to Brighton.	59.4539
"And you saw him frequently?"	40.2960
What an agreeable man Sir
William is, Mr. Bingley--is not he?	102.6682
Elizabeth's astonishment was beyond expression.	59.5930
"And may I ask?"	67.2938
The very mention of any
thing concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour, and
wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of.	75.3543
This was one point, with
regard to Lydia at least, which was now to be settled, and Mr. Bennet
could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him.	48.9371
Mr.
Collins then returned to Elizabeth.	21.9602
"But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I
acknowledge?"	44.2420
I came to try you.	33.3105
About a year ago, she was taken from
     school, and an establishment formed for her in London; and last
     summer she went with the lady who presided over it, to Ramsgate;
     and thither also went Mr. Wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there
     proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and Mrs.
     Younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and by
     her connivance and aid, he so far recommended himself to Georgiana,
     whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his
     kindness to her as a child, that she was persuaded to believe
     herself in love, and to consent to an elopement.	83.1559
They could describe an
entertainment with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh
at their acquaintance with spirit.	89.6908
She endeavoured to secure Jane in
her interest, but Jane with all possible mildness declined
interfering;--and Elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and
sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks.	104.6892
But I pity her, because she must feel that she has been
     acting wrong, and because I am very sure that anxiety for her
     brother is the cause of it.	38.6953
From
what he said of Miss Darcy, I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud,
reserved, disagreeable girl.	67.9130
VOL.	115.6968
He took the hint,
and when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud,

"That will do extremely well, child.	49.8446
She followed him with
her eyes, envied every one to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience
enough to help anybody to coffee; and then was enraged against herself
for being so silly!	64.5595
She longed to
speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs.
Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to
Jane, with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy.	52.7400
I am not so
     selfish, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient.	26.1361
"And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?"	33.9287
"Our habits of expence make us too dependant, and there are not many in
my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to
money."	119.2468
"If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have no idea
of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine."	56.0596
Elizabeth's impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could no
longer be overcome; and at length resolving to suppress every particular
in which her sister was concerned, and preparing her to be surprised,
she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between Mr.
Darcy and herself.	63.7211
In his library he had been
always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told
Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the
house, he was used to be free from them there; his civility, therefore,
was most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters in their
walk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker
than a reader, was extremely well pleased to close his large book, and
go.	68.2314
Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down
again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command.	58.4429
She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her
sister must bring them more frequently together.	45.5710
Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr. and Mrs. Collins sat
down to quadrille; and as Miss De Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the
two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs. Jenkinson to make up her
party.	39.5766
"Oh!	7.8559
However, your coming just at this time is the
greatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us, of
long sleeves."	50.7489
I wish you had been there.	22.8015
Mr. Bingley and Jane were standing together, a little detached from the
rest, and talked only to each other.	37.7977
"And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own
credit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many, I have more
than I ever look into."	74.3524
I found that
Miss Darcy was expected to dinner.	35.6194
"He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard
them from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to
him _conditionally_ only."	53.0096
"Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again?--At
present I have not room to do them justice."	63.0870
or, why did he thus come a day before he was expected?	67.6381
Their table was superlatively stupid.	64.6058
Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."	42.7494
Mrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state.	32.1348
CHAPTER III.	15.1432
Mr. Bingley followed his advice.	24.9403
CHAPTER XV.	15.1432
An express came at twelve last night, just as we were
     all gone to bed, from Colonel Forster, to inform us that she was
     gone off to Scotland with one of his officers; to own the truth,
     with Wickham!--Imagine our surprise.	75.9485
Amazed at the
alteration in his manner since they last parted, every sentence that he
uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the
impropriety of her being found there, recurring to her mind, the few
minutes in which they continued together, were some of the most
uncomfortable of her life.	89.3478
He
certainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that
look was disputable.	42.4796
It originated in
Mrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found
Elizabeth's arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred
her husband's.	54.1658
cried Wickham with a look which did not escape her.	34.8263
"Did Mr. Darcy give you his reasons for this interference?"	79.7384
Mrs. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to
supper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the
others, and she had no opportunity of detaining them.	49.3083
I will try again.	30.4800
I often tell my other girls they are nothing to
_her_.	47.1282
He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my
acquaintance, but that is all.	57.8728
When the first
transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were
over, he naturally returned to all his former indolence.	98.2473
And as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but
tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses, to buy them,
after they are married.	50.5950
Thank Heaven!	24.5623
But will they make you happy?"	68.3251
'Lady
Catherine,' said she, 'you have given me a treasure.'	16.1211
Collins listened to her
with the determined air of following his own inclination, and when she
ceased speaking, replied thus,

"My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world of your
excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your
understanding, but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference
between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity, and those
which regulate the clergy; for give me leave to observe that I consider
the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank
in the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the
same time maintained.	77.6717
"Your plan is a good one," replied Elizabeth, "where nothing is in
question but the desire of being well married; and if I were determined
to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it.	54.1876
This idea
lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the
turning past, he was immediately before them.	138.9189
It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr. Bingley to see you
all after him so soon; for, if I recollect right, he went but the day
before.	57.6653
But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I
am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away."	55.2262
At such a distance as _that_, you know, things are strangely
misrepresented."	65.5385
I know of nobody that is coming I am sure,
unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in, and I hope _my_ dinners
are good enough for her.	84.0865
As to
his real character, had information been in her power, she had never
felt a wish of enquiring.	45.9238
"I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out, if
possible, from some of the young man's intimates in the regiment,
whether Wickham has any relations or connections, who would be likely to
know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself.	47.7242
You alluded to something else.	39.1300
They had long wished to see him.	21.8057
I was in the middle before I
knew that I _had_ begun."	40.7205
"I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley's being imposed on, than
that Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me
last night; names, facts, every thing mentioned without ceremony.--If it
be not so, let Mr. Darcy contradict it.	67.4797
It was as
follows:

     "MY DEAR SIR,

     "I feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation
     in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now
     suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter
     from Hertfordshire.	69.2279
You must learn some
of my philosophy.	51.4100
I do not know a place in the country that is
equal to Netherfield.	24.5235
"Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such
affectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily receive
from me a letter of thanks for this, as well as for every other mark of
your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire.	65.9305
"DEAR SIR,

     "I must trouble you once more for congratulations.	61.7586
It appears to me so very unlikely, that any young man should
form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or
friendless, and who was actually staying in his colonel's family, that I
am strongly inclined to hope the best.	70.7698
As long as she stays
there, it is all very well.	38.8540
But while he was mortal,
there must be a triumph.	35.6214
Who should suffer but myself?	71.9903
Her father captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance
of good humour, which youth and beauty generally give, had married a
woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind, had very early in
their marriage put an end to all real affection for her.	78.3107
"By this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried
     letter; I wish this may be more intelligible, but though not
     confined for time, my head is so bewildered that I cannot answer
     for being coherent.	75.3698
I came to you without a
doubt of my reception.	36.7379
His cousin was as absurd
as he had hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment,
maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance,
and except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner in
his pleasure.	63.8944
During their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet's consent should be
asked in the course of the evening.	36.1759
"Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with
many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few
neighbourhoods larger.	58.3820
"I believe her to be both in a great degree," replied Wickham; "I have
not seen her for many years, but I very well remember that I never liked
her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent.	52.2356
"Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement."	58.1262
"Come here, child," cried her father as she appeared.	52.1890
_You_ cannot have
been always at Longbourn."	13.2503
It was many months since she had mentioned his name to
Elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said,

"I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present
report; and I know I appeared distressed.	42.0960
And even when it
was settled that Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster, the necessity of
opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me.	39.7028
"Ah!	48.3580
"To be sure, Lizzy," said her aunt, "he is not so handsome as Wickham;
or rather he has not Wickham's countenance, for his features are
perfectly good.	44.7903
Our situation
with regard to Lady Catherine's family is indeed the sort of
extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast.	104.1775
Her ladyship's carriage is regularly ordered for us.	63.8155
I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression.	21.6340
We passed each other
several times.	109.4106
Arguments are too much like disputes.	147.1540
--She could have added, "A young man too, like _you_, whose very
countenance may vouch for your being amiable"--but she contented
herself with "And one, too, who had probably been his own companion from
childhood, connected together, as I think you said, in the closest
manner!"	81.6103
As for the gentleman himself, _his_ feelings were chiefly expressed, not
by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by
stiffness of manner and resentful silence.	83.9382
You must not suspect me.	14.3311
With a strong
prejudice against every thing he might say, she began his account of
what had happened at Netherfield.	49.1723
was a question
which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered the room, and
from all the others when they sat down to table.	32.5778
who attended to you?	40.6327
They met again on Sunday, and
     then _I_ saw him too.	30.3263
But is it
certain, absolutely certain?"	102.8170
We neither of us perform to strangers."	105.8610
"I might as well enquire," replied she, "why with so evident a design of
offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me
against your will, against your reason, and even against your character?	61.7332
You deserve no such attention.	46.9041
It was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of
Miss Bennet's mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face, as
made her look handsomer than ever.	68.7189
"I began to be afraid you would never come back again.	38.8646
As no objection was made to the young people's engagement with their
aunt, and all Mr. Collins's scruples of leaving Mr. and Mrs. Bennet for
a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach
conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; and the
girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room,
that Mr. Wickham had accepted their uncle's invitation, and was then in
the house.	54.8927
Mr. Darcy bowed.	16.4341
You need not send them word at
     Longbourn of my going, if you do not like it, for it will make the
     surprise the greater, when I write to them, and sign my name Lydia
     Wickham.	68.4089
You know my sentiments."	31.9034
"Oh, yes.	37.4943
She shook her head.	9.2437
Those who do not complain are never
pitied."	108.7669
With the kindest concern he
     came on to Longbourn, and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner
     most creditable to his heart.	65.7819
I am sick of them all.	15.5308
Mrs.
Bennet's eyes sparkled.--"A gentleman and a stranger!	55.0194
Miss De Bourgh was pale and sickly; her
features, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very
little, except in a low voice, to Mrs. Jenkinson, in whose appearance
there was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening
to what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before
her eyes.	55.3843
no."	32.1469
Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow.	32.9281
"We are not in a way to know _what_ Mr. Bingley likes," said her mother
resentfully, "since we are not to visit."	28.8437
"If it were merely a fine house
richly furnished," said she, "I should not care about it myself; but the
grounds are delightful.	43.9997
Her aunt asked her, smilingly, how she liked it.	56.1811
Brother-in-law of Wickham!	68.0501
They were to be off as soon as possible.	23.2981
"That you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had--not turned
out well.	35.0417
At present we
have nothing to guide us.	37.0907
She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear
of seeing Mr. Darcy--that Mr. Darcy might leave the country, but that
_he_ should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball
the very next week.	48.0244
A lady's
imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love
to matrimony in a moment.	76.5249
I should be glad to take a turn in it, if you
will favour me with your company."	39.6072
Your sweetness
and disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know what to say to
you.	51.5043
The gentlemen arrived early; and, before Mrs. Bennet had time to
tell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat in
momentary dread, Bingley, who wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed
their all walking out.	80.8593
Collins must excuse
me.--He can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear.	47.4563
good or bad?"	159.0198
"I am not now to learn," replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave of the
hand, "that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the
man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their
favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a
third time.	62.5780
Not, however, from any fear of
disadvantage from it, individually to herself; for at any rate, there
seemed a gulf impassable between them.	63.3854
"And of your infliction," cried Elizabeth with energy.	48.1500
Elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his
gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her
manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody; and Darcy had
never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her.	67.8717
"Is this a hint to me, Lizzy," said her father, "to send for the
horses?"	41.4692
Their affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered what
she had herself endured on a similar occasion, five and twenty years
ago.	144.9778
He had entertained hopes of being
admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard
much; but he saw only the father.	64.0555
"My dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak, as to be in danger now."	24.5842
"And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least
great pleasure in the power of choice.	36.9096
"Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?"	46.4687
Recovering himself, however, shortly,
he turned to his partner, and said,

"Sir William's interruption has made me forget what we were talking of."	50.7286
When all this was resolved
     on, he returned again to his friends, who were still staying at
     Pemberley; but it was agreed that he should be in London once more
     when the wedding took place, and all money matters were then to
     receive the last finish.	69.4871
Darcy,
as well as Elizabeth, really loved them; and they were both ever
sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringing
her into Derbyshire, had been the means of uniting them.	71.7388
I have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will
include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she
honours us during your stay here.	97.3152
Lady Catherine rose also, and they turned
back.	33.2548
As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass
between the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have defended either or
both, had they appeared to be wrong, she could no more explain such
behaviour than her sister.	58.9007
He could number the fields in every direction,
and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump.	60.6108
My character has ever been
celebrated for its sincerity and frankness, and in a cause of such
moment as this, I shall certainly not depart from it.	54.6661
"My dear sir," replied Mr. Collins, "I am particularly obliged to you
for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so
material a step without her ladyship's concurrence."	32.5809
Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?"	65.1952
"Certainly not."	36.8832
Come as soon as you can on the receipt of
     this.	28.9499
Pray, how _violent was_ Mr. Bingley's
love?"	82.6162
"And yours," he replied with a smile, "is wilfully to misunderstand
them."	42.7713
She had
got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight,
and was certain of a willing listener in Jane, whenever she might wish
to talk again of either.	62.2052
"Oh!	7.8559
His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his
attentions to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her feeling
herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the
others.	63.8488
Could she exert herself it would be better, but
     this is not to be expected; and as to my father, I never in my life
     saw him so affected.	40.3471
Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting
the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again.	77.3879
"Your affectionate friend,

     "LYDIA BENNET."	58.5339
Dear, dear Lizzy.	18.7668
My sisters may write to _me_.	37.6409
Kitty was the
only one who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation and envy.	79.3317
If therefore she
actually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to
force her into accepting me, because if liable to such defects of
temper, she could not contribute much to my felicity."	90.1052
Let _our_ first effusions be less
insupportable than those of the generality of travellers."	116.5588
Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister's room, and in the
morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the
enquiries which she very early received from Mr. Bingley by a housemaid,
and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his
sisters.	57.7500
Lady
Catherine's unjustifiable endeavours to separate us, were the means of
removing all my doubts.	59.6458
They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother.	72.6545
"My manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally I assure you.	38.6714
Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards
took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest,
whether _all_ her sisters were at Longbourn.	55.8115
After breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Mr. Wickham
were returned, and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball.	64.0297
She saw instantly that her
cousin's manners were not altered by his marriage; his formal civility
was just what it had been, and he detained her some minutes at the gate
to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her family.	85.3415
The
wish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his
feeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a
blow as this.	56.5895
but from what the report of
their engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine;
till she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of Bingley,
and _her_ being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the
expectation of one wedding, made every body eager for another, to supply
the idea.	82.5127
"He is perfectly well behaved, polite, and unassuming," said her uncle.	35.6534
What a contrast between him and his friend!	79.8346
"Oh!	7.8559
He called it, therefore, his duty to step
     forward, and endeavour to remedy an evil, which had been brought on
     by himself.	39.4982
The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had
produced of what Mr. Darcy might have been doing to forward her sister's
match, which she had feared to encourage, as an exertion of goodness too
great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be just, from the
pain of obligation, were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true!	70.4494
My aunt told me so
herself on Saturday.	43.8184
On reaching the house, they were shewn through the hall into the saloon,
whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer.	64.4327
She likes to have the distinction of rank
preserved."	36.4778
Mrs. Collins will be very glad of your
company, I am sure."	24.0203
Elizabeth, who had a letter
to write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea;
for as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be
wanted to counteract her mother's schemes.	43.9194
"Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson; did not
I mention it to you?	62.3497
But pride--where there is a real
superiority of mind, pride will be always under good regulation."	88.4006
That among his own connections he was
esteemed and valued--that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a
brother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of
his sister as to prove him capable of _some_ amiable feeling.	67.9208
But in spite of all this
     fine talking, my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured, that
     your uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given him credit
     for _another interest_ in the affair.	43.7534
His debts are to be paid,
     amounting, I believe, to considerably more than a thousand pounds,
     another thousand in addition to her own settled upon _her_, and his
     commission purchased.	56.2228
On both sides it was only assertion.	50.5097
"It was greatly my wish that he should do so," he added, "as soon
     as his marriage was fixed on.	34.8345
[Illustration: DOVE-DALE]




PRIDE & PREJUDICE.	284.3100
Very little was said by either; Kitty was
too much afraid of him to talk; Elizabeth was secretly forming a
desperate resolution; and perhaps he might be doing the same.	92.2134
But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what
connubial felicity really was.	158.7587
But that is nothing to us.	27.5201
1.D.	348.7562
--cried Elizabeth.	11.7380
"Not one."	37.7685
Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr. Bingley had been a most delightful
friend; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable; but she checked
herself.	81.0329
Mrs. Bennet all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of such
high importance, received her with the utmost politeness.	71.8068
I speak nothing but the truth.	36.8978
To these high
flown expressions, Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of
distrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she
saw nothing in it really to lament; it was not to be supposed that their
absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley's being there; and as
to the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane must soon
cease to regard it, in the enjoyment of his.	55.9081
cried Mrs. Bennet, as she stood at a window the next
morning, "if that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming here again with
our dear Bingley!	56.4646
"He meant, I believe," replied Jane, "to go to Epsom, the place where
they last changed horses, see the postilions, and try if any thing could
be made out from them.	60.0225
I shall then give over every expectation, every wish of
his constancy.	67.2816
"But can you think that Lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him,
as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage?"	51.4270
Another day I will do the same; I will sit in
my library, in my night cap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble
as I can,--or, perhaps, I may defer it, till Kitty runs away."	89.3669
there is not a bit of fish to be got to-day.	25.0720
He begged to know farther particulars of what he
was indebted to his brother; but was too angry with Lydia, to send any
message to her.	50.8985
"She is my youngest girl but one.	42.2402
Had Elizabeth
been able to encounter his eye, she might have seen how well the
expression of heart-felt delight, diffused over his face, became him;
but, though she could not look, she could listen, and he told her of
feelings, which, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his
affection every moment more valuable.	64.4125
Jane's is nothing to it--nothing at all.	64.3160
Why Jane--you never dropt a word of this; you sly thing!	149.4656
Elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more.	70.3380
Every thing being settled between _them_, Mr. Darcy's next step was
     to make your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in
     Gracechurch-street the evening before I came home.	53.6191
Much as I respect them, I believe, I thought
only of _you_."	61.6603
said he hastily, as he opened the door.	38.3299
I am only ashamed of his asking so little."	38.2260
This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham's being among them.	37.2291
I am
sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say
nothing _he_ may not like to hear."	47.1110
"No really," replied Elizabeth; "I think there cannot be too little said
on the subject."	38.1796
Sometimes one
officer, sometimes another had been her favourite, as their attentions
raised them in her opinion.	61.8985
and it was not wholly without foundation.	44.0215
Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention.	24.0945
"Merely to the illustration of _your_ character," said she, endeavouring
to shake off her gravity.	54.7842
In
that respect his friend had greatly the advantage.	77.5397
repeated Darcy contemptuously; "yes, his misfortunes
have been great indeed."	65.0546
Were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain.	90.9662
In an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her
health, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better.	114.0448
"Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed.	53.4932
"Do you suppose them to be in London?"	27.5838
"I do not believe that he will ever live at Netherfield any more."	27.0289
Sir William did not say much.	12.4258
Every thing, however, went on smoothly,
and was finally settled according to Charlotte's first sketch.	38.0532
The beginning contained an account of all their
little parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded;
but the latter half, which was dated a day later, and written in evident
agitation, gave more important intelligence.	128.8665
Their manners are not equal to his."	41.1116
CHAPTER XX.	15.1432
"It keeps him in good
humour," said she, "and I am more obliged to you than I can express."	40.4457
He could even
listen to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away
the brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their all
meeting frequently at St. James's, with very decent composure.	51.3250
Lydia has no
brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father's
behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever
seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that _he_ would
do as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in
such a matter."	62.7954
"Certainly," replied Elizabeth--"there are such people, but I hope I am
not one of _them_.	30.2290
Could he expect to be noticed again by the
regiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster?	52.2941
Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people
in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had
felt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or
pleasure.	58.6127
"I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen
through I am afraid is pitiful."	75.1287
And so, my dear sister, I find from our uncle and aunt, that
you have actually seen Pemberley."	32.7246
Do not be
afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your
privilege of universal good will.	93.2319
She had never heard of his having had any relations, except a father and
mother, both of whom had been dead many years.	60.6585
When the card tables were placed, he had an opportunity of obliging her
in return, by sitting down to whist.	64.4516
"The first wish of my heart," said she to herself, "is never more to be
in company with either of them.	39.2844
"Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane, while she was
ill at Netherfield?"	58.4742
Their manner of living, even when the
restoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the
extreme.	74.7815
After a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an
agitated manner, and thus began,

"In vain have I struggled.	85.6582
Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his thoughts?	38.9751
But on returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was finished, she
saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her mother
had been too ingenious for her.	37.4536
Elizabeth would wonder, and probably would blame her; and though
her resolution was not to be shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such
disapprobation.	43.3297
She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and had
a few minutes' conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever
prevailed on to get out.	51.3488
He then handed her
in, Maria followed, and the door was on the point of being closed, when
he suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they had
hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of Rosings.	49.3062
In the hall they parted.	24.1530
"I confess," said he, "that I should not have been at all surprised by
her Ladyship's asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at
Rosings.	29.4171
He delighted in
going to Pemberley, especially when he was least expected.	74.5468
"When I am in the country," he replied, "I never wish to leave it; and
when I am in town it is pretty much the same.	33.6401
It is unaccountable!	24.8368
*       *       *       *       *

"Good gracious!"	33.8698
But I am very
far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general.	48.9745
The
town where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and where
they were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object of
her curiosity, as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth,
Dovedale, or the Peak.	51.5841
Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is
charming.	49.5612
Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs. Bennet got
rid of her two most deserving daughters.	84.6854
"If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for the
neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we
might possibly get a settled family there.	59.5777
"Design!	1025.0766
Thank God!	258.3959
While the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to spend
the day with them.	56.7690
But her mind was so busily engaged,
that she did not always know when she was silent.	34.5268
He did look at it and into it for half an
hour, was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfied
with what the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately.	76.5612
She was immediately told, that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each
called during her absence; Mr. Darcy, only for a few minutes to take
leave, but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least
an hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after her
till she could be found.--Elizabeth could but just _affect_ concern in
missing him; she really rejoiced at it.	76.2126
Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the
readiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but
his cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house and
garden to Mrs. Collins, sat for some time without speaking to any body.	67.5178
Put them next to your great uncle
the judge.	182.2856
But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham has created, a
     suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his
     real character.	66.7343
My good qualities are under your protection, and you are
to exaggerate them as much as possible; and, in return, it belongs to me
to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may
be; and I shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling
to come to the point at last.	84.7536
But she would not
allow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be
said, for the present.	32.2855
"Read it aloud," said their father, "for I hardly know myself what it is
about."	56.6243
At such a time, much might
have been said, and silence was very awkward.	42.1027
"How abominable!--I wonder that the very
pride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you!--If from no better
motive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest,--for
dishonesty I must call it."	72.5327
What could be the meaning of it?--It was impossible to imagine; it was
impossible not to long to know.	30.5587
"Does that young lady know Mr.	93.0488
It is something to think of, and gives her a sort of distinction among
her companions.	42.3878
"I have an excessive regard for Jane Bennet, she is really a very sweet
girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well settled.	53.8152
shocking!"	34.3439
Now, seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and
dependence?	139.5316
Till the next
morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her
contrivance.	26.1903
If _she_ does not object to it,
why should _we_?"	46.9237
There was no help
for it however.	34.7534
She saw with the creative eye of
fancy, the streets of that gay bathing place covered with officers.	101.3171
As he spoke there was a sort of smile, which Elizabeth fancied she
understood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and
Netherfield, and she blushed as she answered,

"I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her
family.	51.6859
In Three Volumes.	22.8365
When the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to Elizabeth,

"Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel.	34.1064
she added, "by far too much.	52.2665
Girls, can I do any
thing for you in Meryton?	63.5420
Heaven forbid!	296.0160
Your lively talents would place you in the
greatest danger in an unequal marriage.	116.8273
And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr. Darcy, whose
reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose astonishment at
being so addressed was very evident.	92.8918
"Yes--the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best
living in his gift.	47.5192
On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his
respects.	63.1696
"It is a circumstance which Darcy of course would not wish to be
generally known, because if it were to get round to the lady's family,
it would be an unpleasant thing."	47.6852
With many compliments to them,
and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the
houses, he unfolded the matter,--to an audience not merely wondering,
but incredulous; for Mrs. Bennet, with more perseverance than
politeness, protested he must be entirely mistaken, and Lydia, always
unguarded and often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed,

"Good Lord!	91.6956
You know I have.	24.2403
it is of no consequence.	41.4134
The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news, and
telling again what had been already written; and when it closed,
Elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon
Charlotte's degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding,
and composure in bearing with her husband, and to acknowledge that it
was all done very well.	82.4409
I remain, dear sir, with respectful compliments to
     your lady and daughters, your well-wisher and friend,

     WILLIAM COLLINS."	89.7744
There were
few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended;
but at the same time, there was no one, whose knowledge of a sister's
frailty would have mortified her so much.	61.8236
To his
tacit engagement with Miss De Bourgh?	44.0810
The first part of Mrs. Gardiner's business on her arrival, was to
distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions.	72.8705
"Mr. Collins," said she, "speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her
daughter; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship,
I suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in spite of her being his
patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman."	52.6112
A promise
of secrecy was of course very dutifully given, but it could not be kept
without difficulty; for the curiosity excited by his long absence, burst
forth in such very direct questions on his return, as required some
ingenuity to evade, and he was at the same time exercising great
self-denial, for he was longing to publish his prosperous love.	89.5679
Not that I am afraid
of _myself_, but I dread other people's remarks."	49.3091
"Yes--but as it happens, they are all of them very clever."	57.4162
She
could not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her
question, and read on.	43.8202
Make haste, make haste.	31.5296
She
heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs.	41.9168
Had not my own feelings decided
against you, had they been indifferent, or had they even been
favourable, do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept
the man, who has been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the
happiness of a most beloved sister?"	69.0094
"What do you think?	14.1099
"Oh!"	7.8559
What he told me was merely this; that he congratulated himself
on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most
imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other
particulars, and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him
the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from
knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer."	80.7993
She wrote even
to Jane on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat all her
former professions of regard.	38.0479
The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost
contempt.	67.7770
I dare say I shall
soon see them here."	22.4947
Elizabeth immediately recognising the
livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of surprise
to her relations, by acquainting them with the honour which she
expected.	76.6681
She was on the point of continuing her walk,
when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which
edged the park; he was moving that way; and fearful of its being Mr.
Darcy, she was directly retreating.	64.6566
Easter was approaching, and the week preceding it, was to bring an
addition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a circle must be
important.	68.3515
He bore with philosophy the conviction that
Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude
and falsehood had before been unknown to her; and in spite of every
thing, was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on
to make his fortune.	89.5718
It was lady Catherine de Bourgh.	8.1637
How much sooner one tires of any thing than of a
book!--When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not
an excellent library."	68.0608
but checking himself, he added in a gayer tone, "Is it in
address that he improves?	69.0691
Lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but Mr.
Collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said,

"I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books
of a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit.	73.1825
They went to the library,
therefore, and asked their father, whether he would not wish them to
make it known to her.	29.2314
Elizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply;
and at length, by repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was really the
object of her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her
estimation of him had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that
his affection was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many
months suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities, she
did conquer her father's incredulity, and reconcile him to the match.	68.0895
Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could
regard with any complacency.	40.5033
Poor Lydia's situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it was no
worse, she had need to be thankful.	64.6498
She was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to see
whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the
Bingleys and Jane; and she thought he looked a little confused as he
answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet.	35.5259
But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be
suspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Mrs.
Gardiner's letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him.	44.5837
It was borne in the latter with decent
philosophy.	64.0571
If, indeed, it should be so!	43.0399
Elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was in such misery
of shame, that she could hardly keep her seat.	33.0000
Only look at her.	51.0284
She follows him to
town in the hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he
does not care about you."	53.8531
"Your list of the common extent of accomplishments," said Darcy, "has
too much truth.	58.8393
"Do you prefer reading to cards?"	68.0129
You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas.	31.4442
Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in.	98.7149
But
these are not Jane's feelings; she is not acting by design.	109.2844
Charles, when you build _your_ house, I wish it may be
half as delightful as Pemberley."	74.2448
Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters
declared that they were miserable.	48.1487
At present, indeed, they were well supplied both with
news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the
neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was the
head quarters.	66.6549
exclaimed Elizabeth, "you are too good.	37.9353
"Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him
myself; how can you be so teazing?"	49.6547
A low phaeton, with a nice little
     pair of ponies, would be the very thing.	55.3171
"A place too, with which so many of your
acquaintance are connected.	114.9362
You are determined to ruin him in
the opinion of all his friends, and make him the contempt of the world."	23.1421
I will take care of
myself, and of Mr. Wickham too.	29.6398
"Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from
doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections.	61.0303
"It must make you better satisfied that your other four are
single."	54.0057
"I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!"	67.3163
"It is a long time, Mr. Bingley, since you went away," said Mrs. Bennet.	18.1843
"Exceed their income!	309.2327
accompanied by a violent yawn.	71.5635
On Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost
all, took place.	84.0969
"Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude," replied Elizabeth, "have any
possible claim on me, in the present instance.	62.0045
To the civil enquiries which then
poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the
much superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley's, she could not make a very
favourable answer.	55.9959
and turning round, he looked for a moment at
Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said,
"She is tolerable; but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; and I am in no
humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted
by other men.	74.3996
I have told Miss Bennet several times, that
she will never play really well, unless she practises more; and though
Mrs. Collins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as I have often
told her, to come to Rosings every day, and play on the piano-forte in
Mrs. Jenkinson's room.	47.6888
I
am sure my sisters must all envy me.	20.3002
Her niece was,
therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house
on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their
progress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the
taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the
occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the man
about them, that he advanced but little.	49.5501
I flatter myself at least that you will
be able to do so.	38.6179
Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for
while he was present, Jane had no attention to bestow on any one else;
but she found herself considerably useful to both of them, in those
hours of separation that must sometimes occur.	73.0823
"Miss Eliza Bennet," said Miss Bingley, "despises cards.	23.3504
That he was _surprised_ by the
connexion was evident; he sustained it however with fortitude, and so
far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into
conversation with Mr. Gardiner.	59.2671
"I am talking of possibilities, Charles."	49.9742
We want none of them;
do we?"	135.7448
"And Mary King is safe!"	42.5876
The housekeeper came forward, and told them it was the picture of a
young gentleman, the son of her late master's steward, who had been
brought up by him at his own expence.--"He is now gone into the army,"
she added, "but I am afraid he has turned out very wild."	36.5649
It is
wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that
way.	30.0328
"She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him."	32.1130
"My dearest sister, now _be_ be serious.	34.2970
By this time she is
actually with them!	51.9167
Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had liked
him better when they met in Kent than before, and that she had never
seen him so pleasant as this morning.	37.8944
If it was not allowable for him to gain _my_
affections, because I had no money, what occasion could there be for
making love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equally
poor?"	62.7084
He has the
     promise of an ensigncy in General ----'s regiment, now quartered in
     the North.	51.4247
Mr.
Darcy, you cannot deny the fact."	26.6245
She could neither
wonder nor condemn, but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing
consolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress.	78.5944
"What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr.	139.8805
"I did not know that you intended to walk," said Miss Bingley, in some
confusion, lest they had been overheard.	25.2217
Her many attractions were again dwelt on, and Caroline
boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict
the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former
letter.	70.2567
On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have
any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such
a subject to him, which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, she
turned to him and said,

"Did not you think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly well
just now, when I was teazing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at
Meryton?"	55.4876
"In essentials, I believe, he is very much
what he ever was."	40.6550
No officer is ever to enter my house
again, nor even to pass through the village.	62.7775
For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.	105.8092
She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no
other reply to Elizabeth's salutation, than a slight inclination of the
head, and sat down without saying a word.	44.1271
Mr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth--and it was soon
done--done while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire.	70.1204
She wanted to talk, but
there seemed an embargo on every subject.	34.4837
"No governess!	40.4088
"As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes, my dear," said Mrs. Bennet, "you
will wait on him of course."	18.2058
But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect
of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her
spirits; and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she had
not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to
the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular
notice.	51.5512
As they drove to Mr. Gardiner's
door, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival; when
they entered the passage she was there to welcome them, and Elizabeth,
looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and
lovely as ever.	56.0635
"The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the
preservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my
opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I hope, quite so easily
changed as that implies."	72.9659
Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.	84.7508
Had you not been really
amiable you would have hated me for it; but in spite of the pains you
took to disguise yourself, your feelings were always noble and just; and
in your heart, you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously
courted you.	94.9620
In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing at the
sight of each other.	25.1399
Oh!	7.8559
I
     thank you, again and again, for not going to the Lakes.	35.1835
I have known him
too long and too well to be a fair judge.	52.1284
One morning, about a week after Bingley's engagement with Jane had been
formed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the
dining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window, by the
sound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the
lawn.	54.7968
What I have to say relates to
     poor Lydia.	57.6116
Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of his
history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have
principally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct,
the probity and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that
Mr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has
received; and I am sorry to say that by his account as well as his
sister's, Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man.	48.5425
Elizabeth
noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an
attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal.	49.8348
I did not know before, that I had _two_ daughters on the brink
of matrimony.	36.7952
Mr. Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject; and
affectionately taking her hand, said in reply,

"Do not make yourself uneasy, my love.	46.4606
They were, therefore, to go.--Elizabeth was pleased, though,
when she asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.	50.0624
And on the gentlemen's approaching, one of
the girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper,

"The men shan't come and part us, I am determined.	64.4380
When they sat down to
supper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which
placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find
that her mother was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely,
openly, and of nothing else but of her expectation that Jane would be
soon married to Mr.	58.2874
When tea was over, Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the
card-table--but in vain.	44.9080
It is the greatest of favours
when Miss De Bourgh comes in."	59.1147
"Care of him!--Yes, I really believe Darcy _does_ take care of him in
those points where he most wants care.	96.4064
"This is the consequence you see, Madam, of marrying a daughter," said
Elizabeth.	45.2340
I could not
allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months
last winter, that I had known it, and purposely kept it from him.	36.7955
How can Mr. Bingley,
who seems good humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly amiable,
be in friendship with such a man?	65.9477
At any rate, she cannot grow
many degrees worse, without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest
of her life."	44.6754
He really
believed, that were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he
should be in some danger.	42.1686
"I am not going to run away, Papa," said Kitty, fretfully; "if _I_
should ever go to Brighton, I would behave better than Lydia."	36.3138
Darcy!"	28.3342
"Oh!	7.8559
I shall be glad to have the
library to myself as soon as may be."	24.0773
"An excellent consolation in its way," said Elizabeth, "but it will not
do for _us_.	32.7484
cried Miss Bingley.	11.6861
Whatever bears affinity to cunning is
despicable."	193.8872
They
ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room; from thence to the
library;--their father was in neither; and they were on the point of
seeking him up stairs with their mother, when they were met by the
butler, who said,

"If you are looking for my master, ma'am, he is walking towards the
little copse."	53.6600
"Thank you, Sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me.	43.1726
I hate to see you
standing about by yourself in this stupid manner.	81.2550
cried Jane, "what do you mean, Sir?"	20.7037
Jane was not deceived, but she was
affected; and though feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing
her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved.	72.3628
"Something very much to the purpose of course.	47.6907
"Oh!	7.8559
"Oh!	7.8559
She had obtained private intelligence that Mr.
Darcy did not wish for cards; and Mr. Hurst soon found even his open
petition rejected.	75.3783
Mr.
Bingley's defence of his friend was a very able one I dare say, but
since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt
the rest from that friend himself, I shall venture still to think of
both gentlemen as I did before."	68.5537
Her father, contented with laughing at
them, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his
youngest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right
herself, was entirely insensible of the evil.	79.3630
"My motive for cautioning you, is as follows.	69.8967
I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably
well, when she came into the room this morning.	52.0912
"Haye-Park might do," said she, "if the Gouldings would quit it, or the
great house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but Ashworth is
too far off!	94.6149
Were it known to the rest
of my family, I should not have merely my own gratitude to express."	31.6594
Elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last
Kitty did, she very innocently said, "What is the matter mamma?	74.9608
He was fond of
the country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal
enjoyments.	71.8404
The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the
entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the
finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many a
significant look and smile from Mrs. Annesley to Miss Darcy had been
given, to remind her of her post.	87.1374
"I am, dear Sir, &c. &c."

Mr. Gardiner did not write again, till he had received an answer from
Colonel Forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send.	48.5731
He readily agreed to it.	45.0189
You may possibly
     wonder why all this was not told you last night.	62.3102
"I never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for any thing about the entail.	28.9769
"I am thinking of what you have been telling me," said she.	19.3177
The
adieu is charity itself.	106.7484
In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a
note sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her
own judgment of her situation.	49.5810
So imprudent a
     match on both sides!--But I am willing to hope the best, and that
     his character has been misunderstood.	62.9875
I cannot be
     otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your
     amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologise for it, as well as to
     assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends,--but
     of this hereafter.	59.0474
I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very
     much, and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live
     upon without some help.	47.1948
They solaced their wretchedness,
however, by duets after supper, while he could find no better relief to
his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every
possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.	105.4593
to Miss Lydia Bennet,' without there being a
syllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or any thing.	60.8666
Ten thousand a year!	39.4859
I rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that it
would happen.	36.4094
She was disappointed,
and angry with herself for being so.	43.9439
There is but such a quantity of merit between them; just
enough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting
about pretty much.	75.8374
But Georgiana would not join
her.	33.6296
As they went down stairs together, Charlotte said,

"I shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza."	43.7112
Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled.	37.8974
Do not distress me by the idea.	34.0451
It is evident that you belong to the
first circles.	34.1417
Elizabeth jumped out; and, after giving each of them an hasty kiss,
hurried into the vestibule, where Jane, who came running down stairs
from her mother's apartment, immediately met her.	79.5778
"Miss Bingley," said he, "has given me credit for more than can be.	32.3119
"Your picture may be very exact, Louisa," said Bingley; "but this was
all lost upon me.	59.8832
Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your
advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant guide, though
in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education and
habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like
yourself."	99.9218
He spoke of it as a certain event,
     of which the time alone could be undecided.	60.7721
It is only that he has better means of having it than
many others, because he is rich, and many others are poor.	61.2036
A
little time therefore.--I shall certainly try to get the better."	53.9779
I
thank you for explaining it so fully.	83.7273
I am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not get
over it immediately.	35.1123
Mr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in
conversation with the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth's high
diversion, was stationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the
greatness before him, and constantly bowing whenever Miss De Bourgh
looked that way.	56.0485
That he was really fond of Jane, she doubted no more than she
had ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she
could not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness
of temper, that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave
of his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to
the caprice of their inclinations.	47.7972
Not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did
Mrs. Bennet give up the point.	37.6769
Much had been done, and much
had been said in the regiment since the preceding Wednesday; several of
the officers had dined lately with their uncle, a private had been
flogged, and it had actually been hinted that Colonel Forster was going
to be married.	49.3043
"You may as well call it impertinence at once.	61.0876
"_That_ you certainly shall."	43.8807
Though I
_know_ it must be a scandalous falsehood; though I would not injure him
so much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved on
setting off for this place, that I might make my sentiments known to
you."	59.8628
But gracious me!	47.8177
and what can _he_ have to say?"	43.0676
LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.	97.0630
You wanted me, I know, to say 'Yes,'
that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always
delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of
their premeditated contempt.	56.5993
Such a countenance, such manners!	77.7651
Her fellow-travellers the next day, were not of a kind to make her think
him less agreeable.	76.1873
"Oh, lord!	19.8226
Yet time and her aunt moved slowly--and her patience
and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tête-à-tête was over.	94.5150
Elizabeth was pleased to find, that he had not betrayed the interference
of his friend, for, though Jane had the most generous and forgiving
heart in the world, she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice
her against him.	41.0353
My situation in life, my connections
with the family of De Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are
circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into farther
consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no
means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you.	80.4094
Lizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in Bingley's
way."	30.2799
That he should even speak to
her was amazing!--but to speak with such civility, to enquire after her
family!	80.6675
what is the matter?"	28.9959
And what sort of young lady is she?	57.0726
She had
gained her point, and had time to consider of it.	33.9480
"For the liveliness of your mind, I did."	38.8838
Elizabeth went away with her head full of him.	25.8426
She could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to converse
with her, he might have better success.	28.3999
"I will go to Meryton," said she, "as soon as I am dressed, and tell the
good, good news to my sister Philips.	24.1289
I could not have parted with
you, my Lizzy, to any one less worthy."	44.3913
Day after
day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the
report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to
Netherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed Mrs.
Bennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous
falsehood.	119.3109
On opening the door, she perceived her
sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth, as if engaged in
earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion, the faces of
both as they hastily turned round, and moved away from each other, would
have told it all.	78.4479
"No, my dear; I think not.	24.8932
They found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough bass and human
nature; and had some new extracts to admire, and some new observations
of thread-bare morality to listen to.	94.6082
If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the
younger Miss Bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time,
for from the day of the invitation, to the day of the ball, there was
such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once.	57.0524
In the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for half an
hour by themselves; and Elizabeth instantly availed herself of the
opportunity of making many enquiries, which Jane was equally eager to
satisfy.	58.4164
"They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them."	51.9991
He had before believed her to return his
     affection with sincere, if not with equal regard.--But Bingley has
     great natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgment
     than on his own.--To convince him, therefore, that he had deceived
     himself, was no very difficult point.	72.0736
She turned from sister to sister, demanding their
congratulations, and when at length they all sat down, looked eagerly
round the room, took notice of some little alteration in it, and
observed, with a laugh, that it was a great while since she had been
there.	50.3657
Collins has
made an offer to Lizzy, and she will not have him."	44.0407
But his anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained
in any doubt of your sister's sentiments.	43.7045
I am sure I sha'nt get a wink of sleep all night.	79.0972
He and his sisters were well, I hope, when you left London."	32.5250
All
Elizabeth's anger against him had been long done away; but, had she
still felt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the
unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself, on seeing her
again.	71.8667
"Not so much as I could wish, Sir; but I dare say he may spend half his
time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months."	58.3503
To be sure it would have been more for the advantage of
conversation, had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town; or, as the
happiest alternative, been secluded from the world, in some distant farm
house.	63.2611
Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not
disgrace you, and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated,
especially when a certain desirable event, my dear Miss Eliza, (glancing
at her sister and Bingley,) shall take place.	52.4546
But you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill."

Lydia declared herself satisfied.	59.8452
It was all
     over before I arrived; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked
     as _your's_ seems to have been.	63.7940
Its banks
were neither formal, nor falsely adorned.	149.9670
But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object.	55.3226
Elizabeth had frequently
united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine
and Lydia; but while they were supported by their mother's indulgence,
what chance could there be of improvement?	127.5091
He protested that except Lady
Catherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman; for
she had not only received him with the utmost civility, but had even
pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although
utterly unknown to her before.	54.3669
Jane and Elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail.	98.0166
The two first dances, however, brought a return of distress;
they were dances of mortification.	64.0640
I could hardly keep my countenance.	31.7424
The subjection in which his father had brought him up, had
given him originally great humility of manner, but it was now a good
deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in
retirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected
prosperity.	64.2350
Mrs. Philips was quite awed by such an excess of good
breeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to
by exclamations and inquiries about the other, of whom, however, she
could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that Mr. Denny had
brought him from London, and that he was to have a lieutenant's
commission in the ----shire.	50.1262
Perhaps other people have said so before, but not one
     with such justice.	89.9465
Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed
     their attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot
     wonder.	77.0109
But
of all the views which his garden, or which the country, or the kingdom
could boast, none were to be compared with the prospect of Rosings,
afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly
opposite the front of his house.	57.4956
She counted
the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent;
hopeless of seeing him before.	85.2441
"Oh!--Your uncle!--He keeps a man-servant, does he?--I am very glad you
have somebody who thinks of those things.	87.8843
"They have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are
all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of
quickness than her sisters."	98.1203
But papa is so
disagreeable."	38.7738
"Why, I must confess, that I love him better than I do Bingley.	41.0023
Thoughtlessness,
want of attention to other people's feelings, and want of resolution,
will do the business."	77.6277
I can now
say with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud,
_I_ have seen nothing of it."	50.6977

my uncle!"	34.5510
I knew it myself, as
     it was known to Miss Bingley, but her brother is even yet ignorant
     of it.--That they might have met without ill consequence, is
     perhaps probable;--but his regard did not appear to me enough
     extinguished for him to see her without some danger.--Perhaps this
     concealment, this disguise, was beneath me.--It is done, however,
     and it was done for the best.--On this subject I have nothing more
     to say, no other apology to offer.	48.9923
I think she will be pleased with the hermitage."	26.4788
It
was not in their direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it.	45.6357
"Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town;
and by that means, as I told Lady Catherine myself one day, has deprived
the British court of its brightest ornament.	99.5860
You and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us.	52.9072
"The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so.	60.7991
"I never heard that it was."	18.5416
When
she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance, and courting the good opinion
of people, with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a
disgrace; when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to the
very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected their last
lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage, the difference, the change was so
great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could hardly
restrain her astonishment from being visible.	66.8344
"With my mother up stairs.	36.4318
"Are you, indeed?	44.4923
You know, sister, we agreed long ago never to
mention a word about it.	76.8298
Darcy!"	28.3342
You
may have drawn him in."	31.6794
My temper
would perhaps be called resentful.--My good opinion once lost is lost
for ever."	180.7433
I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine, that her
charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess, and that the most
elevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by
her.--These are the kind of little things which please her ladyship, and
it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to
pay."	76.7534
They returned therefore in good
spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they
were the principal inhabitants.	71.0352
"My real purpose was to see _you_, and to judge, if I could, whether I
might ever hope to make you love me.	54.5742
Kitty is slight and delicate, and Mary studies so much, that her hours
of repose should not be broken in on.	80.0183
"Perhaps it will be as well, if you discourage his coming here so very
often.	50.0160
They were then,
with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance,
taken into the house; and as soon as they were in the parlour, he
welcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble
abode, and punctually repeated all his wife's offers of refreshment.	62.1918
Who would
have thought it!	36.5898
They were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap
situation, and always spending more than they ought.	58.5693
At his own ball he
offended two or three young ladies, by not asking them to dance, and I
spoke to him twice myself, without receiving an answer.	73.4818
He was resolutely silent however; and, from a
determination of making him speak, she continued,

"I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how amazed we all
were to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I particularly recollect
your saying one night, after they had been dining at Netherfield, '_She_
a beauty!--I should as soon call her mother a wit.'	92.2127
Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit."	43.9213
I must confess myself
     surprised by your application; I did not expect it from _you_.	38.9948
But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds
at Pemberley."	63.2907
_I_ did for you.	30.0629
"He seems to be a most
conscientious and polite young man, upon my word; and I doubt not will
prove a valuable acquaintance, especially if Lady Catherine should be so
indulgent as to let him come to us again."	58.9721
In her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying
Colonel Fitzwilliam.	53.5088
You
mentioned _two_ instances.	101.6140
"You may well warn me against such an evil.	64.1373
The colour now rushed into Elizabeth's cheeks in the instantaneous
conviction of its being a letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt;
and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained
himself at all, or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to
herself; when her father continued,

"You look conscious.	77.6631
She said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in
silence; on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree, for
in Darcy's breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her,
which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against
another.	72.0346
She was
to accompany Sir William and his second daughter.	29.8333
His sister was less delicate, and directed her eye towards
Mr. Darcy with a very expressive smile.	46.5858
Mr. Darcy corroborated it with a bow, and
was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth, when they
were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger, and Elizabeth
happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other,
was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting.	46.4343
Such
squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity,
are not worth a regret.	48.6835
but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a
presumption!	121.0338
"Oh!	7.8559
But still he would be her husband.--Without thinking highly
either of men or of matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it
was the only honourable provision for well-educated young women of small
fortune, and however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their
pleasantest preservative from want.	153.2700
As she spoke, she observed him looking at her earnestly, and the manner
in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to
give them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other
got pretty near the truth.	67.7755
Not a soul knew of it, but Col. and Mrs.
Forster, and Kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow
one of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked!	51.9935
he has _some_ friends, though perhaps not so
many as he deserves."	63.2931
sir, I do indeed.	26.4738
I think every thing has passed off uncommonly well,
I assure you.	30.5672
Here, leading the way through every walk and cross
walk, and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he
asked for, every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left
beauty entirely behind.	162.0170
Why any fear of detection?	138.8900
1.E.5.	294.5474
By all that I have
ever read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed, that human
nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us
who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some
quality or other, real or imaginary.	62.4694
"You may depend upon my not mentioning it."	30.8231
Make
haste, and come down this moment."	28.1980
That he has neither integrity nor honour.	60.2512
"Oh!	7.8559
It is nearly fifty miles."	50.3331
Darcy."	35.1269
"Ah!	48.3580
Elizabeth was watchful enough to
see it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain.	56.0987
When they parted, Lady Catherine, with great condescension, wished them
a good journey, and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year;
and Miss De Bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her
hand to both.	50.4404
She then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far
as they concerned George Wickham.	30.8149
Bingley and Jane, however, soon allowed the others to
outstrip them.	49.0651
After
lamenting it however at some length, she had the consolation of thinking
that Mr. Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn,
and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that, though
he had been invited only to a family dinner, she would take care to have
two full courses.	61.4885
Elizabeth read on; "I have seen them both.	46.7636
Perhaps I am not doing her justice.	18.8967
"This is an evening of wonders, indeed!	42.0034
He had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three other
gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had left him
only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to
Georgiana that morning.	57.2186
Elizabeth received
them with all the forbearance of civility; and at the request of the
gentlemen remained at the instrument till her Ladyship's carriage was
ready to take them all home.	51.2978
Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great
delight.	67.9920
Mrs. Bennet could hardly comprehend
it.	18.3590
Her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and
welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand with an affectionate smile to
Wickham, who followed his lady, and wished them both joy, with an
alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness.	77.7294
There was no arguing upon such a project.	53.6503
Oh!	7.8559
My dear Jane, Mr. Collins is
a conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man; you know he is, as well
as I do; and you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman who marries
him, cannot have a proper way of thinking.	42.1982
I
had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but I must
so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly
foolish."	115.1990
They were
all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt, that
to be mistress of Pemberley might be something!	66.8166
It might seem as if
she had purposely thrown herself in his way again!	102.3858
The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.	83.2835
Her thoughts were instantly
driven back to the time when Mr. Bingley's name had been last mentioned
between them; and if she might judge from his complexion, _his_ mind was
not very differently engaged.	71.3894
observed Mrs. Bennet.	17.5988
Though he had
detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry
in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and
pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those
of the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness.	61.6043
His present pursuit could not make him forget that
Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the
first to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner
of bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what
she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their
opinion of her--their opinion of every body--would always coincide,
there was a solicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her
to him with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced,
that whether married or single, he must always be her model of the
amiable and pleasing.	84.3352
Some of them were to dine with the Philipses the
next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr.
Wickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn
would come in the evening.	52.2042
"Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not
wait on him.	35.3911
She dared not relate the other
half of Mr. Darcy's letter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely she
had been valued by his friend.	35.5593
He simpers, and smirks, and makes love to us
all.	61.2643
She would not
even wish for any renewal of his attentions.	25.5534
The promised
letter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on Tuesday, addressed to their
father, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a
twelvemonth's abode in the family might have prompted.	64.5959
Mr. Bennet could not have chosen
better.	20.9323
And so would Anne, if her health
had allowed her to apply.	60.3514
"Do not you want to know who has taken it?"	37.3527
"My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed."	38.4788
"Pray do, my dear Miss Lucas," she added in a melancholy tone,
"for nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me, I am cruelly used,
nobody feels for my poor nerves."	66.5010
"It is well.	16.5644
Their taking her home, and affording her their personal
protection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage, as
years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge.	106.7378
In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself?	99.5056
"Well, then--supposing them to be in London.	29.1245
"It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his
reason.	33.8605
It cannot be done too much; and when I next write
to her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account.	44.4083
In spite of having been at St. James's, Sir William was so completely
awed, by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage
enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word;
and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge
of her chair, not knowing which way to look.	50.3179
My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers.	34.0691
"She has one only daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very
extensive property."	55.2224
"No more have I," said Mr. Bennet; "and I am glad to find that you do
not depend on her serving you."	34.0388
"I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley's sincerity," said Elizabeth warmly;
"but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only.	53.6794
"Not perhaps of neglecting his own interest.	89.2346
"_You_ began the evening well, Charlotte," said Mrs. Bennet with civil
self-command to Miss Lucas.	59.5716
Indeed, Mr. Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention
all that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire--and, give me
leave to say, very impolitic too--for it is provoking me to retaliate,
and such things may come out, as will shock your relations to hear."	66.9951
"With the officers!"	50.0241
"But I can assure you," she added, "that Lizzy does not lose much by not
suiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at
all worth pleasing.	56.3110
It seemed like wilful
ill-nature, or a voluntary penance, for on these occasions it was not
merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away, but he
actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her.	107.3323
I have not a doubt of your
doing very well together.	29.8587
His behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive; he had
either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying
his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most
incautiously shewn.	76.4075
It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often
doubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it
seemed nothing but absence of mind.	77.6288
Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject.	23.8479
"Dear Lizzy!"	16.5667
She had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that
Lydia had any partiality for him, but she was convinced that Lydia had
wanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body.	44.1739
"I think she will.	31.0115
I shall not go away, till you have given me the
assurance I require."	48.1284
Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help
fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its aspect
and its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her, as if
wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him.	50.5192
On the
gentlemen's appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with
tolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any
symptom of resentment, or any unnecessary complaisance.	102.5758
"And is this all?"	93.3976
"Whatever I do is done in a hurry," replied he; "and therefore if I
should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in five
minutes.	65.3873

"I expected at least that the pigs
were got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her
daughter!"	50.0042
They
entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through
a beautiful wood, stretching over a wide extent.	77.7027
"It may do very well for the others," replied Mr. Bingley; "but I am
sure it will be too much for Kitty.	27.2160
cried Elizabeth, as soon as they
were by themselves.	11.2355
Since her
being at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud;
but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her, that she was
only exceedingly shy.	40.0141
After abusing you so
abominably to your face, I could have no scruple in abusing you to all
your relations."	68.6686
Darcy?"	45.1040
"That is not very likely; our authority was too good."	56.2672
Our plain
manner of living, our small rooms, and few domestics, and the little we
see of the world, must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like
yourself; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension,
and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending
your time unpleasantly."	71.8725
And with regard to the
resentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former
_were_ excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moment's
concern--and the world in general would have too much sense to join in
the scorn."	39.8596
He studies too much for
words of four syllables.--Do not you, Darcy?"	113.9754
She seems perfectly happy, however, and in a
prudential light, it is certainly a very good match for her."	34.9394
To Mr. Bennet's
acknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurances of his eagerness to
promote the welfare of any of his family; and concluded with intreaties
that the subject might never be mentioned to him again.	72.2068
Their
arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets; and Jane more especially,
who gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had _she_
been the culprit, was wretched in the thought of what her sister must
endure.	83.9000
Mrs. Hill began instantly to express her joy.	40.4084
This letter is from Mr.	39.7776
Mrs. Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine
there, that day; but, though she always kept a very good table, she did
not think any thing less than two courses, could be good enough for a
man, on whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and
pride of one who had ten thousand a-year.	54.7145
"Lady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her happy,
for she loves to be of use.	42.4493
The country is a vast deal
pleasanter, is not it, Mr.	54.5784
Her teeth are
tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes, which
have sometimes been called so fine, I never could perceive any thing
extraordinary in them.	64.0655
It was
the last of the regiment's stay in Meryton, and all the young ladies in
the neighbourhood were drooping apace.	43.9795
A thousand things may arise in six months!"	187.8875
How is
such a man to be worked on?	44.8071
They met several times,
     for there was much to be discussed.	42.6016
He had found the law a most unprofitable study,
     and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained, if I would
     present him to the living in question--of which he trusted there
     could be little doubt, as he was well assured that I had no other
     person to provide for, and I could not have forgotten my revered
     father's intentions.	70.6500
Then shewing
her purchases: "Look here, I have bought this bonnet.	166.7357
CHAPTER IV.	15.1432
I know your
disposition, Lizzy.	30.7657
Whenever Charlotte came to see
them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and
whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was convinced that
they were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself
and her daughters out of the house, as soon as Mr. Bennet were dead.	40.8562
They insist also on
     my seeing Mr. Jones--therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear
     of his having been to me--and excepting a sore-throat and head-ache
     there is not much the matter with me.	88.5672
Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it came
from Netherfield, and was opened immediately.	64.5382
You give me
fresh life and vigour.	73.4000
This room was my late
master's favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used to
be then.	75.5997
And she was only sixteen last June.	63.9185
While they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different
doors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady Catherine very much
objected to be kept waiting for her dinner.--Such formidable accounts of
her Ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened Maria Lucas,
who had been little used to company, and she looked forward to her
introduction at Rosings, with as much apprehension, as her father had
done to his presentation at St. James's.	58.4674
cried Miss Bingley, "Charles writes in the most careless way
imaginable.	51.7706
The advice
was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head
ached acutely.	103.2291
Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment, nor were
the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had in fact
nothing to do elsewhere.	87.8978
Oh!	7.8559
Lady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed out of
spirits, and immediately accounting for it herself, by supposing that
she did not like to go home again so soon, she added,

"But if that is the case, you must write to your mother to beg that you
may stay a little longer.	43.2975
Your's, very
     sincerely,

     "M.	157.7457
"'Tis an etiquette I despise," said he.	94.1204
Lady Catherine was generally speaking--stating the mistakes
of the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself.	79.0842
"No--why should he?	67.6727
She longed to see Mrs. Philips, the Lucases, and all
their other neighbours, and to hear herself called "Mrs. Wickham," by
each of them; and in the mean time, she went after dinner to shew her
ring and boast of being married, to Mrs. Hill and the two housemaids.	56.2655
"My style of writing is very different from yours."	82.3753
But it was a hope
shortly checked by other considerations, and she soon felt that even her
vanity was insufficient, when required to depend on his affection for
her, for a woman who had already refused him, as able to overcome a
sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with Wickham.	68.7494
"I do, indeed," replied Elizabeth, colouring.	24.1724
Mrs. Hurst and her
sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue, and
were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves.	56.8308
Elizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this,
heard it in silent indignation.	64.2994
"Removed!"	77.5057
"Do you really think so?"	69.1989
"I see what you are feeling," replied Charlotte,--"you must be
surprised, very much surprised,--so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to
marry you.	45.4090
He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by
being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him."	53.2848
This match, to which you have the
presumption to aspire, can never take place.	55.2248
It was acknowledged,
however, that he was a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.	34.5610
"How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet!	25.6946
And gravely glancing
at Mr. Darcy, "There is a fine old saying, which every body here is of
course familiar with--'Keep your breath to cool your porridge,'--and I
shall keep mine to swell my song."	90.3949
I wish you had been there, my
dear, to have given him one of your set downs.	31.9441
"No, Lizzy, that is what I do _not_ choose.	27.2491
I was so afraid you know that something would happen to put
it off, and then I should have gone quite distracted.	44.8015
"Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy.	23.1288
She put down the
letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be
impartiality--deliberated on the probability of each statement--but with
little success.	102.2911
"Complied with!	103.9626
Let me congratulate you, on a very important conquest."	32.2572
She attracted him more than he liked--and Miss
Bingley was uncivil to _her_, and more teazing than usual to himself.	45.3313
"Have you any idea, Lizzy, who this gentleman is?	85.3343
You have employed your
time much better.	48.9336
But
I have an aunt, too, who must not be longer neglected."	58.1101
The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.	91.3860
"I told you the other day,
of his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy; and you, yourself, when last at
Longbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man, who had behaved
with such forbearance and liberality towards him.	60.3424
But no
sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had
hardly a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered
uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes.	58.6796
But she is too much like her brother,--very,
very proud.--As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and
extremely fond of me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her
amusement.	57.3459
She
must own that she was tired of great houses; after going over so many,
she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains.	111.8626
The arrival of letters was
the first grand object of every morning's impatience.	68.2564
Now and then, they were honoured with a call from her Ladyship,
and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during
these visits.	79.8917
She coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor any thing
else, awakened a suspicion of the truth.	52.2830
He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went
away, an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and Mrs.
Bennet's means, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband.	55.6525
Sir William Lucas, and his daughter Maria, a good
humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had nothing to say that
could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much delight
as the rattle of the chaise.	56.7280
Your
reproof, so well applied, I shall never forget: 'had you behaved in a
more gentleman-like manner.'	75.6224
"What can be the meaning of this!"	28.5334
By the Author of "Sense and Sensibility."	21.9071
Mr. Darcy may
perhaps have _heard_ of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but he would
hardly think a month's ablution enough to cleanse him from its
impurities, were he once to enter it; and depend upon it, Mr. Bingley
never stirs without him."	58.3812
In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference with her
father had been short and to the purpose.	44.3626
"Oh!	7.8559
She could
think of nothing but of Mr. Wickham, and of what he had told her, all
the way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as
they went, for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent.	53.8723
But with _me_, it is not so.	33.0969
"Have you any other objection," said Elizabeth, "than your belief of my
indifference?"	38.0205
Darcy.--She felt all the perverseness of the mischance that
should bring him where no one else was brought; and to prevent its ever
happening again, took care to inform him at first, that it was a
favourite haunt of hers.--How it could occur a second time therefore was
very odd!--Yet it did, and even a third.	83.1105
The recollection of what I
then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of
it, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me.	44.7472
said Elizabeth to herself.--"You are much mistaken if
you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this.	50.2777
"It _is_ wonderful,"--replied Wickham,--"for almost all his actions may
be traced to pride;--and pride has often been his best friend.	69.6181
They were off Saturday night about twelve, as
     is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at
     eight.	137.9765
Their visits to Mrs. Philips were now productive of the most interesting
intelligence.	44.2585
My object
has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with due
consideration for the advantage of all your family, and if my _manner_
has been at all reprehensible, I here beg leave to apologise."	69.0256
We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to
Brighton.	30.7863
It was at Sir William Lucas's, where a large party were
assembled.	40.2542
She respected, she
esteemed, she was grateful to him, she felt a real interest in his
welfare; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to
depend upon herself, and how far it would be for the happiness of both
that she should employ the power, which her fancy told her she still
possessed, of bringing on the renewal of his addresses.	50.2386
No thanks to his gallantry for that.	46.8236
Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her
delight in the prospect of their relationship.	49.7997
The girls grieved over such a number of ladies; but were comforted the
day before the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve, he had brought
only six with him from London, his five sisters and a cousin.	81.5947
I have not been used to submit to any person's whims.	40.2048
Kitty and me were to spend
the day there, and Mrs. Forster promised to have a little dance in the
evening; (by the bye, Mrs. Forster and me are _such_ friends!)	56.2157
They were now almost at the door of the house, for she had walked fast
to get rid of him; and unwilling for her sister's sake, to provoke him,
she only said in reply, with a good-humoured smile,

"Come, Mr. Wickham, we are brother and sister, you know.	37.7039
why did she come?	28.2103
Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away.	31.6012
"My object _then_," replied Darcy, "was to shew you, by every civility
in my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past; and I hoped
to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you
see that your reproofs had been attended to.	68.2051
How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own
journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day!	111.9930
You know my mother's ideas as to the
necessity of constant company for her friends.	36.5506
She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion
of her."	32.6918
Whilst wandering on in this
slow manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeth's astonishment was
quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy
approaching them, and at no great distance.	49.7441
I have just as much
right to be asked as she has, and more too, for I am two years older."	54.4661
"Have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity?"	90.6780
His air was grave and
stately, and his manners were very formal.	37.3330
Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing
how _she_, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its
acceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head.	61.6690
"If we are ever able to learn what Wickham's debts have been," said
Elizabeth, "and how much is settled on his side on our sister, we shall
exactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for them, because Wickham has
not sixpence of his own.	50.4628
Her pale face and impetuous
manner made him start, and before he could recover himself enough to
speak, she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia's
situation, hastily exclaimed, "I beg your pardon, but I must leave you.	66.8677
"I know not, Miss Elizabeth," said he, "whether Mrs. Collins has yet
expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us, but I am very
certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for
it.	37.1104
She was now in an irritation as violent from
delight, as she had ever been fidgetty from alarm and vexation.	44.1644
"No," said Colonel Fitzwilliam, "that is an advantage which he must
divide with me.	28.6691
By Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, they were noticed only by a curtsey; and
on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be,
succeeded for a few moments.	60.2368
Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy's meditated
elopement.	58.5408
The path just admitted three.	96.6826
Only let me assure you, my dear Miss Elizabeth,
that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in
marriage.	69.1977
Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley.	45.1536
She had
spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with
Charlotte, and the kind attentions she had received, must make _her_
feel the obliged.	80.4509
Mrs. Collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest
pleasure, and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming, when
she found herself so affectionately received.	63.6783
"Do not give way to useless alarm," added he, "though it is right to be
prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain.	55.2465
For, though your
accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my behaviour
to you at the time, had merited the severest reproof.	110.0650
As a
child I was taught what was _right_, but I was not taught to correct my
temper.	61.7181
"How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the
year!	46.9124
My aunt's intelligence had given me
hope, and I was determined at once to know every thing."	42.6758
CHAPTER XIX.	15.1432
Pray make my excuses to Pratt, for not keeping my
     engagement, and dancing with him to-night.	68.8778
pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for
there is such a sight to be seen!	41.3110
But her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their own
arrival at Lambton, these visitors came.	84.8850
what news?	126.8908
I am no
stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister's infamous
elopement.	38.7570
But you know married women have never much time for
writing.	94.2671
If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.	51.3560
Painful recollections will
intrude, which cannot, which ought not to be repelled.	54.0625
There was
novelty in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such
uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change
was not unwelcome for its own sake.	65.1717
I knew you would be wishing me joy."	38.2980
James's?"	65.5166
And there are several of the young men, too, that she
likes very much.	31.8074
But whether she
were violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it
was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to
her sense; and she could no more bear that Mr. Darcy should hear the
first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her
disapprobation.	59.2744
CHAPTER V.


Every object in the next day's journey was new and interesting to
Elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment; for she had
seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health,
and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight.	67.8144
"What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?"	58.3250
If his own vanity, however, did not mislead him,
_he_ was the cause, his pride and caprice were the cause of all that
Jane had suffered, and still continued to suffer.	44.7915
"I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an
impression.	52.9569
While the contents of the first
letter remained on her mind, she was all surprise--all astonishment that
Wickham should marry a girl, whom it was impossible he could marry for
money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him, had appeared
incomprehensible.	59.3714
"Well, then, you need not be under any alarm.	35.3260
But as to your
other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good.	40.0103
This was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her
ideas.	93.4443
"Your first position is false.	77.4176
It was really a very
handsome thought.	35.6580
The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature, must
guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its
continuance; and Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and
disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that
establishment were gained.	113.4219
Wherever you and Jane are known,
you must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to less
advantage for having a couple of--or I may say, three very silly
sisters.	105.1443

He did trace them easily to
     Clapham, but no farther; for on entering that place they removed
     into a hackney-coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them
     from Epsom.	108.9841
But before she had been three minutes in her own room,
her mother followed her.	35.4203
I thank you
again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but
to accept them is absolutely impossible.	50.2730
Georgiana had the highest opinion
in the world of Elizabeth; though at first she often listened with an
astonishment bordering on alarm, at her lively, sportive, manner of
talking to her brother.	73.6766
She is
not such a simpleton.	17.1332
Its effect was most
extraordinary; for on first hearing it, Mrs. Bennet sat quite still, and
unable to utter a syllable.	93.3300
His behaviour to us has,
     in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire.	66.9284
Mrs.
Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield
party.	33.1169
As for my fair cousins,
though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, I shall
now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting
my cousin Elizabeth."	62.5742
"That is very strange.	27.8186
"Yes; to the last.	51.7015
so
genteel and so easy!--He has always something to say to every
body.--_That_ is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy
themselves very important and never open their mouths, quite mistake the
matter."	104.0780
It was some days, however, before they
received any invitation thither, for while there were visitors in the
house, they could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day,
almost a week after the gentlemen's arrival, that they were honoured by
such an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to
come there in the evening.	57.5477
But she is very young; she has never
been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half year,
nay, for a twelvemonth, she has been given up to nothing but amusement
and vanity.	55.0367
She declared her resolution.	18.0280
It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise; I
     hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure.	55.4392
"I wonder my aunt did not tell us of
_that_."	38.2824
They talked of his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit, of every
thing but himself; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs. Gardiner
thought of him, and Mrs. Gardiner would have been highly gratified by
her niece's beginning the subject.	45.1374
Mrs. Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner; and then
added,

"May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left Mr. and
Mrs. Collins well."	89.5602
she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld!	81.2702
"I never saw a more promising inclination.	30.2888
Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get
acquainted with him; and Mr. Bennet soon assured her that he was rising
every hour in his esteem.	46.3455
Do not imagine, Miss Bennet, that your
ambition will ever be gratified.	40.7159
"I believe she did--and I am sure she could not have bestowed her
kindness on a more grateful object."	35.4165

Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.	49.7702
When alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject.	57.2662
From his garden, Mr. Collins would have led them round his two meadows,
but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white
frost, turned back; and while Sir William accompanied him, Charlotte
took her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased,
probably, to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husband's
help.	66.2679
Lord!	49.6754
It was Mr. Collins's picture of Hunsford and
Rosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait
for her own visit there, to know the rest.	54.0330
Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy in any
thing, and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two
motives.	39.7353
Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme; assuring him
that Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as
an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that it
was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either
side, and that if it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in
consequence, to begin the acquaintance.--Mr.	53.5313
You need not.	15.4200
Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture
they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two
that they now saw Mr. Darcy, the gardener's expression of surprise, on
beholding his master, must immediately have told it.	88.0695
It will not do.	16.5997
When first
he entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all
were.	55.2641
yes--it would be much better to
wait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely Captain Carter
would be at Meryton again.	69.4418
"She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind.	48.4423
Let me hear what it is."	28.8225
No look appeared
on either side that spoke particular regard.	116.7837
It was in the Times and the Courier, I know;
though it was not put in as it ought to be.	47.0584
cried Elizabeth; "but how could _that_ be?--How could
his will be disregarded?--Why did not you seek legal redress?"	99.9119
She was shewn into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Jane were
assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of
surprise.--That she should have walked three miles so early in the day,
in such dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs.
Hurst and Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her
in contempt for it.	51.7966
the ladies had crowded round the table,
where Miss Bennet was making tea, and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee,
in so close a confederacy, that there was not a single vacancy near her,
which would admit of a chair.	57.4514
Sometimes she could fancy, that he talked less than on
former occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that
as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance.	84.4112
Oh!	7.8559
And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine
about this report?	64.3427
Find such a woman as soon as
you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.'	42.4041
After welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table set
out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming,
"Is not this nice?	150.8253
I only hope they may have half my
good luck.	52.0405
Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me,
because it would be imprudent; and now, because he is trying to get a
girl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is
mercenary."	46.1133
Mr. Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding
on Miss Bennet, and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying
much to any body, went away.	37.3340
But _now_ suppose as much as you chuse; give a
     loose to your fancy, indulge your imagination in every possible
     flight which the subject will afford, and unless you believe me
     actually married, you cannot greatly err.	90.6797
It was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that
his affection might be re-animated, and the influence of his friends
successfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane's
attractions.	55.4876
"Thank you--but I always mend my own."	38.3643
Mr. Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth.	46.8084
She was at least free from the offence of Mr. Darcy's farther notice;
though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite
disengaged, he never came near enough to speak.	65.9362
"But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham."	57.2608
Lady Catherine had been rendered so
exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew's letter, that
Charlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till
the storm was blown over.	53.9576
How long has she been such a favourite?--and pray when am I to wish you
joy?"	123.5713
"Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you chuse," said Mr. Bennet; and,
as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.	28.5462
There is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings!"	58.9561
Never, even in the company
of his dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations at
Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from
self-consequence, or unbending reserve as now, when no importance could
result from the success of his endeavours, and when even the
acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed, would draw
down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and
Rosings.	67.7490
In this danger Kitty
is also comprehended.	101.4919
"Perhaps I do.	37.1846
"I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours," he coldly replied.	99.8357
"Books--Oh!	398.1459
Miss Bingley said something of his never
     returning to Netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not
     with any certainty.	55.0975
But when her mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to go down
without one of her sisters.	26.7454
In making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your
feelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbourn
estate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach.	57.6442
You promised me
to _insist_ upon her marrying him."	26.8236
But on the following morning, every hope of this
kind was done away.	58.1567
"Yes, very different.	26.3298
"You need not distress yourself.	27.4821
"Indeed I had.	35.3202
He paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not disposed to
make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was
struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to
her,

"My dear Miss Eliza, why are not you dancing?--Mr.	53.3230
And poor Mr. Darcy!	54.4502
Who
could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there
(an invitation moreover including the whole party) so immediately after
your arrival!"	88.9458
I declare after all there is no
enjoyment like reading!	151.9341
She longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind; in
what manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of every thing,
she was still dear to him.	41.4369

in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER

Let me thank you again and again,
in the name of all my family, for that generous compassion which induced
you to take so much trouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the
sake of discovering them."	47.7173
"Very well.--That reply will do for the present.--Perhaps by and bye I
may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public
ones.--But _now_ we may be silent."	151.5924
"I am grieved, indeed," cried Darcy; "grieved--shocked.	39.2000
Were it for nothing but his love of you, I
must always have esteemed him; but now, as Bingley's friend and your
husband, there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me.	70.2276
She endeavoured to
persuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be
blind to Miss Bingley's inattention.	39.0537
Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr.	17.4776
Well,
Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love."	39.1086
Mary's powers were by no means fitted for such a display;
her voice was weak, and her manner affected.--Elizabeth was in agonies.	86.5649
Her ladyship seemed pleased
with the idea, and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to
offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to
ladies.	63.1537
"Beyond a doubt, they _do_ wish him to chuse Miss Darcy," replied Jane;
"but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing.	78.8589
The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the
world, though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had first run away,
they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune.	51.1465
"Aye--that is because you have the right disposition.	91.2224
Mr. Darcy would
never have come so soon to wait upon me."	37.0504
The note was immediately dispatched, and
its contents as quickly complied with.	85.2921
"I am not one and twenty."	20.4231
There was also a legacy of one thousand pounds.	23.4015
What sister would think
herself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very
objectionable?	109.7341
They were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was his
appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight.	56.3234
When convinced on that article, Miss Bennet had nothing
farther to wish.	78.8663
There is no danger of Wickham's marrying Mary King.	62.0213
Be that as it may, she saw him go
with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia's infamy must
produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched
business.	110.1671
His countenance rather gained in austerity; and he scarcely
opened his lips.	96.4486
Such a circumstance could only
exasperate farther, and when he ceased, the colour rose into her
cheeks, and she said,

"In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to
express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however
unequally they may be returned.	55.8790
"They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though I
sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant
compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, I always wish to
give them as unstudied an air as possible."	72.0972
His understanding and
temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes.	65.9239
She began at length to recover, to
fidget about in her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless
herself.	66.3413
"I never saw any one so shocked.	33.9137
To Caroline's
assertion of her brother's being partial to Miss Darcy she paid no
credit.	63.4138
mamma, do the
people here abouts know I am married to-day?	107.3385
"You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, Sir."	33.5565
"True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room.	63.6599
She
complained bitterly of all this to her husband.	45.7973
but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and
when I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, I
think it will be very tolerable.	68.4021
Kitty then owned, with a very natural
triumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in Lydia's last
letter, she had prepared her for such a step.	60.0806
After a short silence, the lady first spoke.	62.5913
"Oh!	7.8559
Very
nonsensical to come at all!	52.0669
In this room they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting there
with Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in
London.	41.5834
You tear them to pieces."	59.6088
But, though
this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his behaviour
to Miss Darcy, who had been set up as a rival of Jane.	33.5925
Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy.	33.7998
Lydia--the
humiliation, the misery, she was bringing on them all, soon swallowed up
every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief,
Elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else; and, after a pause of
several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the
voice of her companion, who, in a manner, which though it spoke
compassion, spoke likewise restraint, said, "I am afraid you have been
long desiring my absence, nor have I any thing to plead in excuse of my
stay, but real, though unavailing, concern.	72.5495
The whole of what Elizabeth had already
heard, his claims on Mr. Darcy, and all that he had suffered from him,
was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and every body was
pleased to think how much they had always disliked Mr. Darcy before they
had known any thing of the matter.	43.1013
The dejection was almost
universal.	55.5653
Howsoever that may be, you
     are grievously to be pitied, in which opinion I am not only joined
     by Mrs. Collins, but likewise by lady Catherine and her daughter,
     to whom I have related the affair.	45.7462
It is almost past belief.	46.2682

Jane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to Elizabeth.	41.8430
Ring the bell,
Kitty, for Hill.	103.4990
Bromley, of course.--If you mention my name at the Bell,
you will be attended to."	76.9691
It was drawn at the same time as the
other--about eight years ago."	52.1347
"Perfectly so--I thank you."	27.9981
Give my love to Colonel Forster, I hope you
     will drink to our good journey.	34.1894
The discussion of Mr. Collins's offer was now nearly at an end, and
Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily
attending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother.	55.1118
He begged
pardon for having displeased her.	66.9494
your father of course may spare you, if your mother can.--Daughters
are never of so much consequence to a father.	109.4659
Mrs. Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no
more, and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account
for it clearly, there seemed little chance of her ever considering it
with less perplexity.	85.2592
She found that she was to receive no other answer--and, after a short
pause, added,

"I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of ever
returning to Netherfield again?"	42.4119
His letter was
soon dispatched; for though dilatory in undertaking business, he was
quick in its execution.	84.3426
Elizabeth
dared not lift up her eyes.	50.9404
You thought me then devoid of every proper
feeling, I am sure you did.	54.7532
You never see a fault in any body.	39.9145
Mrs. Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few
days longer, as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to
her nieces.	43.7772
That is the place to get
husbands.	44.9217
She had been watching him the last hour,
she said, as he walked up and down the street, and had Mr. Wickham
appeared Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the occupation,
but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the
officers, who in comparison with the stranger, were become "stupid,
disagreeable fellows."	55.3523
So far each recital confirmed the other: but when she came to
the will, the difference was great.	83.2493
I ask only a comfortable home; and considering Mr. Collins's
character, connections, and situation in life, I am convinced that my
chance of happiness with him is as fair, as most people can boast on
entering the marriage state."	57.7777
He
bore it with noble indifference, and she would have imagined that
Bingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes
likewise turned towards Mr. Darcy, with an expression of half-laughing
alarm.	43.0612
You had much better
dance."	52.7210
But my dear Lydia, I don't
at all like your going such a way off.	43.9324
So much the better.	37.4188
What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always
coming here?	52.5861
A long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr. Bennet was firm: it
soon led to another; and Mrs. Bennet found, with amazement and horror,
that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his
daughter.	80.6391
_She_ blushed, and Jane blushed; but the cheeks of
the two who caused their confusion, suffered no variation of colour.	76.6198
Though our kind
uncle has done something towards clearing him, I cannot believe that ten
thousand pounds, or any thing like it, has been advanced.	64.9508
Bingley was sure of
being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually giving offence.	75.6163
He made her an offer in this very room,
and she refused him.	50.6328
Charlotte the wife of Mr. Collins,
was a most humiliating picture!--And to the pang of a friend disgracing
herself and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction
that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot
she had chosen.	75.6789
"Already arisen!"	73.9996
I
     take up my pen again to do, what I have just told you I would not,
     but circumstances are such, that I cannot help earnestly begging
     you all to come here, as soon as possible.	49.1362
Anxiety on Jane's behalf, was another prevailing concern, and Mr.
Darcy's explanation, by restoring Bingley to all her former good
opinion, heightened the sense of what Jane had lost.	58.3779
He then told her of Georgiana's delight in her acquaintance, and of her
disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to
the cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of
following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister, had been formed
before he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness
there, had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must
comprehend.	66.5844
His attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and
hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer
the moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at any thing.	64.2733
But at last your uncle was forced
     to yield, and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece,
     was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it,
     which went sorely against the grain; and I really believe your
     letter this morning gave him great pleasure, because it required an
     explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give
     the praise where it was due.	69.8374
She explained what its effect on her had been, and how gradually all her
former prejudices had been removed.	69.1510
But what does he say of the living?"	43.1516
"I had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself--for I am fond of
superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of
London would agree with Lady Lucas."	73.9146
It is
not likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it
might strike them that they could be more economically, though less
expeditiously, married in London, than in Scotland."	56.4580
When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen."	28.3020
"And _your_ defect is a propensity to hate every body."	62.0595
I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband
before you came back.	55.7869
What a stroke was this for poor Jane!	209.8954
Never had his wit been directed in a manner so
little agreeable to her.	75.7150
Her mother's ungraciousness,
made the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth's mind;
and she would, at times, have given any thing to be privileged to tell
him, that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of
the family.	44.3972
In anticipating the happiness of Bingley,
which of course was to be inferior only to his own, he continued the
conversation till they reached the house.	53.2275
This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence, and
the little value he put on his own good qualities.	72.8074
_They_ will
take care not to outrun their income.	50.0158
"And do you really know all this?"	47.4533
--It vexed her to see him
expose himself to such a man.	56.6565
"Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get
Pemberley by purchase than by imitation."	97.5088
But I have
other provocations.	35.9831
But it is very likely that he
_may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as
soon as he comes."	30.1340
"I think I have heard you say, that their uncle is an attorney in
Meryton."	30.6048
But, however, that shan't prevent my asking him to dine
here, I am determined.	50.5221
"I do not know.--I hope there was.--But to be guarded at such a time, is
very difficult.	40.9529
"Oh!	7.8559
Affectation of candour is common enough;--one meets it every
where.	242.5614
I was uncomfortable enough.	37.0573
The moment of her release from
him was ecstacy.	62.4788
"That is all settled;" repeated the other, as she ran into her room to
prepare.	54.5572
Ever since I have known it, I have been most anxious to
acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it.	48.0046
"Mr. Darcy is all politeness," said Elizabeth, smiling.	19.4721
"Indeed I am.	17.8228
In
understanding Darcy was the superior.	60.4784
As he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they
should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had
marked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as she threw a
retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full of
contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those
feelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would
formerly have rejoiced in its termination.	77.4203
As they walked across the lawn towards the river, Elizabeth turned back
to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and while the former was
conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself
suddenly came forward from the road, which led behind it to the stables.	64.2763
She
soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding
to the efforts of his aunt, who _did_ call on him in her return through
London, and there relate her journey to Longbourn, its motive, and the
substance of her conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on
every expression of the latter, which, in her ladyship's apprehension,
peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance, in the belief that
such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from
her nephew, which _she_ had refused to give.	56.7928
The envelope contained a
sheet of elegant, little, hot pressed paper, well covered with a lady's
fair, flowing hand; and Elizabeth saw her sister's countenance change as
she read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages.	101.0341
said Mr. Gardiner.	14.1824
"You shall have it in few words.	58.6996
I cannot do justice to his kindness.	17.2052
"Oh!"	7.8559
[Illustration: A VICARAGE HOUSE.]	129.2006
My fingers wait your orders."	79.5268
"Good gracious!"	33.8698
What pin-money, what jewels, what carriages
you will have!	84.2872
"It
seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane," said she.	23.1156
"But what is to be
done about Pemberley?"	56.4907
Jane should
therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his
attention.	101.4237
But before they heard again from Mr. Gardiner, a letter arrived for
their father, from a different quarter, from Mr. Collins; which, as Jane
had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence,
she accordingly read; and Elizabeth, who knew what curiosities his
letters always were, looked over her, and read it likewise.	72.0100
"Pardon me for interrupting you, Madam," cried Mr. Collins; "but if she
is really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she would
altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who
naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state.	65.6909
--And then, with a
slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of
sight.	38.8630
"La!"	302.5924
Will you tell
me how long you have loved him?"	37.0747
Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was
delighted.	32.2270
Georgiana's reception of them was very civil; but attended with
all that embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the
fear of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves
inferior, the belief of her being proud and reserved.	102.8937
But, unluckily for her
ladyship, its effect had been exactly contrariwise.	68.0776
Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations
which had at length closed her eyes.	48.7855
CHAPTER XIX.	15.1432
On
Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner's coming up, they were all pressed to go into the
house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and they parted
on each side with the utmost politeness.	58.4931
Elizabeth was disgusted, and even Miss Bennet was
shocked.	35.8687
Unfeeling, selfish girl!	623.1853
"From the former.	28.6585
All was acknowledged,
and half the night spent in conversation.	86.6741
"I am exceedingly gratified," said Bingley, "by your converting what my
friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper.	55.9929
But little had she dared
to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.	81.1787
From what she had said of her resolution to
prevent their marriage, it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate
an application to her nephew; and how _he_ might take a similar
representation of the evils attached to a connection with her, she dared
not pronounce.	67.0399
To know
that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish
Jane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her own
vanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptation
to openness as nothing could have conquered, but the state of indecision
in which she remained, as to the extent of what she should communicate;
and her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried into
repeating something of Bingley, which might only grieve her sister
farther.	61.6219
"We are speaking of music, Madam," said he, when no longer able to avoid
a reply.	32.6521
The faces of both, however, were tolerably calm; and no change
was visible in either, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or
the anger which she had herself incurred in the business, had given
something more of fretfulness than usual, to the accents of Kitty.	49.6800
"I dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age."	54.3986
Darcy!--and so it does I vow.	77.1675
They
had nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if
not, it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small
market-town, where the family did not visit.	64.8165
forgive the question--are you quite certain that you can be
happy with him?"	67.8027
He began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards conversing
with her himself, attended to her conversation with others.	57.1435
Darcy."	35.1269
The Lucases are very artful people indeed,
sister.	57.0936
"Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this?"	50.8330
Mrs. Bennet's schemes for this day were ineffectual.	54.6370
You will only think I feel _more_ than I ought to do, when I
tell you all."	34.2204
Elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend.	48.0684
This is not quite
enough to make her understand his character."	22.2564
The rest of the evening passed with the _appearance_, on his side,
of usual cheerfulness, but with no farther attempt to distinguish
Elizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a
mutual desire of never meeting again.	58.0931
I am prodigiously proud of him.	21.1378
Elizabeth
was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and
pleased.	58.6759
How soon any other wishes
introduced themselves I can hardly tell, but I believe in about half an
hour after I had seen you."	76.8241
Elizabeth looked surprised.	33.5493
It was the second week in May, in which the three young ladies set out
together from Gracechurch-street, for the town of ---- in Hertfordshire;
and, as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr. Bennet's carriage was
to meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coachman's
punctuality, both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining-room up
stairs.	77.8104
Every sentence of
kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane.	42.7013
"I knew," said he, "that what I wrote must give you pain, but it was
necessary.	39.2190
I am
afraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy's
regard."	29.6885
Mrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.	22.8132
She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr.
Collins; but _I_ do not think there would have been any fun in it.	35.7615
You could scarcely escape
discredit and misery.	73.5422
Promise me, therefore, to
come to Hunsford."	35.1801
Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to
continue the subject.	36.9618
She had known, it seems,
of their being in love with each other, many weeks."	36.3595
"I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly
beyond my own party."	53.8019
It is not to be supposed
that there was much affection in the case."	19.3805
"Their conduct has been such," replied Elizabeth, "as neither you, nor
I, nor any body, can ever forget.	61.3881
He did not judge your father to be a person whom he could
     so properly consult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed
     seeing him, till after the departure of the former.	49.7020
Mrs. Bennet had no turn for economy, and her
husband's love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their
income.	87.7116
I will put on my things in a moment.	67.7969
But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and
gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved
a novelty to them.	94.7712
She was overpowered by shame and
vexation.	28.9448
"You may readily comprehend," she added, "what my curiosity must be to
know how a person unconnected with any of us, and (comparatively
speaking) a stranger to our family, should have been amongst you at such
a time.	64.9158
"Shall we ask him why a man of sense and
education, and who has lived in the world, is ill qualified to recommend
himself to strangers?"	46.8780
At last she recollected that
she had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale with
great perseverance.	41.0056
Bingley.--It was an animating subject, and Mrs.
Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of
the match.	64.4134
Had Elizabeth been at leisure
to be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was
impossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of
business as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to
be written to all their friends in Lambton, with false excuses for their
sudden departure.	60.2188
You know not what you are
about."	20.4403
Jane resolutely
kept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went
to the window--she looked,--she saw Mr. Darcy with him, and sat down
again by her sister.	43.9889
If I
had known as much this morning, I certainly would not have called on
him.	31.3223
Nothing could
console and nothing appease her.--Nor did that day wear out her
resentment.	142.1910
"If I," said Mr. Collins, "were so fortunate as to be able to sing, I
should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an
air; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly
compatible with the profession of a clergyman.--I do not mean however to
assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to
music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to.	54.0602
He was storing his memory with anecdotes
and noble names.	78.5210
Her power
was sinking; every thing _must_ sink under such a proof of family
weakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace.	69.9204
cried Elizabeth.	11.7380
Why was he to be the judge?"	42.9858
My father supported him at school, and
     afterwards at Cambridge;--most important assistance, as his own
     father, always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have
     been unable to give him a gentleman's education.	54.9956
Oh, brother,
how kind you are!	68.6706
"We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that
evening," said Elizabeth.	48.2163
"I know little of the game, at present," said he, "but I shall be glad
to improve myself, for in my situation of life----" Mrs. Philips was
very thankful for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason.	39.3902
_That_ is all settled."	31.4364
Lady
Catherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement to
Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way.	76.7673
I am only resolved to act in that manner,
which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without
reference to _you_, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me."	64.6127
Lizzy is not a bit better than the
others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so
good humoured as Lydia.	44.6710
She is well, and begs to be dutifully
     remembered to you and her mother.--Your's, &c.

     "E.	71.0929
Say that
urgent business calls us home immediately.	169.8905
Wickham is safe."	32.8739
I was sure you could not
be so beautiful for nothing!	30.9803
Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.	39.5425
But,
my dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley
tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest
degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on
Tuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of
being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend."	48.0027
"_Mr.	24.5133
It adds even another motive.	159.9190
Mrs. Gardiner gave her the
particulars also of Miss Bingley's visit in Gracechurch-street, and
repeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and
herself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the
acquaintance.	55.4522
Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of
his general behaviour, was sharpened into particular resentment, by his
having slighted one of her daughters.	75.9142
"Perhaps it would have been better;" replied her sister.	27.5553
Lady Catherine listened to half a song, and then
talked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away from
her, and moving with his usual deliberation towards the piano-forte,
stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer's
countenance.	80.7044
A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side
calm and concise--and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte
and her sister, just returned from their walk.	51.7283
You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking
and looking, and thinking for _your_ approbation alone.	86.8560
What do
you keep winking at me for?	100.5695
His principal object must be, to discover the
number of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham.	54.9751
"He likes to have his own way very well," replied Colonel Fitzwilliam.	27.4618
But he found, in reply to
     this question, that Wickham still cherished the hope of more
     effectually making his fortune by marriage, in some other country.	62.0128
But every body is to
judge for themselves, and the Lucases are very good sort of girls, I
assure you.	32.1861
Brighton, and a whole
campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor
regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of Meryton."	122.1638
Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters, would be
unpardonable in _me_."	134.8121
But I will no longer importune my young cousin."	62.9307
"Oh, yes!--he was to come there with Wickham, you know.	32.1052
The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but Sir
William's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his
eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and
Jane, who were dancing together.	80.2340

Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,
reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three and twenty years had
been insufficient to make his wife understand his character.	61.5184
"To oblige you, I would try to believe almost any thing, but no one else
could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded that
Charlotte had any regard for him, I should only think worse of her
understanding, than I now do of her heart.	48.8754
Is this to be endured!	46.8659
"I mean, that no man in his senses, would marry Lydia on so slight a
temptation as one hundred a-year during my life, and fifty after I am
gone."	79.8287
His
reception however was of the most flattering kind.	93.4389
I shall tell Colonel
Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not."	36.2915
As
for Mary, she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth
with a countenance of grave reflection, soon after they were seated at
table,

"This is a most unfortunate affair; and will probably be much talked of.	85.2508
_Hunsford, near Westerham, Kent,

     15th October._

     DEAR SIR,

     The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured
     father, always gave me much uneasiness, and since I have had the
     misfortune to lose him, I have frequently wished to heal the
     breach; but for some time I was kept back by my own doubts, fearing
     lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good
     terms with any one, with whom it had always pleased him to be at
     variance.--"There, Mrs.	117.2230
There, shut into her own room,
as soon as their visitor left them, she could think without interruption
of all that she had heard.	36.4523
His behaviour to myself has been
scandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him any thing and every
thing, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory
of his father."	91.8818
How is half such a sum to be
repaid?"	65.8383
said she.	10.9452
Both changed colour,
one looked white, the other red.	187.4915
Not to appear to disgrace his family, to
degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the
Pemberley House, is a powerful motive.	76.9069
Mary and Kitty, thank
Heaven!	36.3265
*       *       *       *       *

The surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor had
been, was very great; but they obligingly satisfied it, with the same
kind of supposition, which had appeased Mrs. Bennet's curiosity; and
Elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject.	60.1349
"A man who had felt less, might."	76.3740
Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet
was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an
epithet.	81.0916
When the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs. Forster to Meryton,
from whence they were to set out early the next morning.	76.5445
They had often attempted it before, but it was a subject on which Mrs.
Bennet was beyond the reach of reason; and she continued to rail
bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of
five daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about.	61.4444
It is an advantage to have it so far from this part of
     the kingdom.	39.5066
What
     he means to do, I am sure I know not; but his excessive distress
     will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest
     way, and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again
     to-morrow evening.	40.7266
The world has been deceived in that respect; and I am happy to
     say, there will be some little money, even when all his debts are
     discharged, to settle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune.	51.4805
They contained no actual complaint, nor was there any
revival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering.	113.0741
Her carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her
waiting-woman was in it.	47.7273
And rising as she thus
spoke, she would have quitted the room, had not Mr. Collins thus
addressed her,

"When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject I
shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given
me; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because I
know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the
first application, and perhaps you have even now said as much to
encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the
female character."	55.5294
cried Mrs. Gardiner.	15.4168
Miss Darcy looked as if she
wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a
short sentence, when there was least danger of its being heard.	64.2937
To Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage
than to herself.	84.5431
"My dearest child," she cried, "I can think of nothing else!	23.2318
Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on
Mrs. Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she
called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was,
though Mrs. Bennet's sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been
enough to drive happiness away.	59.9998
"I dare say you will find him very agreeable."	18.7382

She would not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery
     and corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be
     found.	56.3379

They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and Mrs. Bennet, in
the meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes, which the good
humour, and common politeness of Bingley, in half an hour's visit, had
revived.	60.2307
After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr.
Bennet coolly observed,

"From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two
of the silliest girls in the country.	68.4377
Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.	245.8384
A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de
Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which he
felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness,
mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a
clergyman, and his rights as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of
pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility.	77.7530
She is a
very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs. Hurst and
Miss Bingley.	34.5313
"May we take my uncle's letter to read to her?"	70.7961
Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her.	50.9891
Collins, you
must marry.	35.6981
Well, much good may it do them!	122.3713
Their reception from Mr. Bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite
so cordial.	47.8438
You will
be censured, slighted, and despised, by every one connected with him.	29.3529
repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement.	41.7140
You are so strange!	23.6806
His revenge would have been complete indeed.	61.4485
"His father was an excellent man," said Mrs. Gardiner.	29.2727
I was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon began to take
a proper direction."	71.1947
He had to be sure done much.	45.9149
"Undoubtedly," replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed,
"there is meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend
to employ for captivation.	91.6939
"Lizzy," cried her mother, "remember where you are, and do not run on in
the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home."	41.2790
Since her
father's death, her home has been London, where a lady lives with her,
and superintends her education."	82.5591
And a
special licence.	50.2077
"This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!"	42.2187
As I must
therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me, I
shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by
suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females."	71.1452
And you are
never to stir out of doors, till you can prove, that you have spent ten
minutes of every day in a rational manner."	71.4345
Elizabeth will
     soon be the wife of Mr. Darcy.	31.7959
She anticipated what would be felt in
the family when her situation became known; she was aware that no one
liked him but Jane; and even feared that with the others it was a
_dislike_ which not all his fortune and consequence might do away.	87.7521
She saw her in idea settled in
that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection
could bestow; and she felt capable under such circumstances, of
endeavouring even to like Bingley's two sisters.	128.8486
"They are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so want papa to
take us all there for the summer!	76.8811
Mr. Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham's removal
from the ----shire, as clearly as Mr. Gardiner could do.	40.1022
I was only confused for the moment, because I felt
that I _should_ be looked at.	46.3141
The
venison was roasted to a turn--and everybody said, they never saw so fat
a haunch.	76.0609

As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from
exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia, that she
considered it as the death-warrant of all possibility of common sense
for the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her were it
known, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her
go.	63.0722
Well, if they can be easy with an
estate that is not lawfully their own, so much the better.	42.7374
You do not blame me, however, for refusing him?"	25.0572
He observed to her, at a
moment when the others were talking together, and in a tone which had
something of real regret, that it "was a very long time since he had had
the pleasure of seeing her;" and, before she could reply, he added, "It
is above eight months.	44.7229
Mrs. Collins knew not what to make of him.	36.8652
"Undoubtedly.	59.4852
"It is more than I engage for, I assure you."	21.9651
I remember, as soon as ever I saw him, when
he first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it was
that you should come together.	31.7906
Human nature is so prone to
fall into it!	89.2411
But Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them,
laughingly answered,

"No, no; stay where you are.--You are charmingly group'd, and appear to
uncommon advantage.	73.9260
There is nothing extravagant in _their_
housekeeping, I dare say."	26.1393
"She is a most charming young lady indeed.	40.2785
Perhaps he thought her too young.	44.7077
I
should be sorry to think our friend mercenary."	28.2868
And pray what sort of guardians do you make?	59.9313
So near
a vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to
_his_ easy temper, or _her_ affectionate heart.	102.2844
Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that any
attempt to reason with or sooth her would only increase the irritation.	111.7410
I have no pleasure in
talking to undutiful children.--Not that I have much pleasure indeed in
talking to any body.	50.8390
His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage, for Mr. Collins was walking
the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane,
in order to have the earliest assurance of it; and after making his bow
as the carriage turned into the Park, hurried home with the great
intelligence.	61.8139
You were
not by, when I told mamma, and the others, all about it.	65.7488
Jane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth, which spoke her distress at
such premeditation, and her intreaty that _she_ would not give into it.	70.1336
1.F.5.	620.2054
Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs. Bennet and
the children.	54.5714
And _that_ made the men suspect
something, and then they soon found out what was the matter."	92.2225
"But does Lydia know nothing of this?	73.3431
Mr. Darcy sends you all the love in the world, that he can
     spare from me.	36.3963
Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in
her way.	44.9062
"Well, my dear," said he, when she ceased speaking, "I have no more to
say.	20.2036
Wickham
will soon be gone; and therefore it will not signify to anybody here,
what he really is.	75.8011
Every girl in, or near Meryton, was out of her senses about him
for the first two months; but he never distinguished _her_ by any
particular attention, and, consequently, after a moderate period of
extravagant and wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others
of the regiment, who treated her with more distinction, again became her
favourites."	91.6989
But I am particularly
attached to these young men; and know them to be so much attached to
me!--They were excessively sorry to go!	51.9242
Teazing, teazing, man!	181.9636
"Gracechurch-street, Monday,

     August 2.	170.8905
I do not know any body who seems
more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr.	35.3370
"No--I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of
something else."	64.9569
"I _have_ heard from authority, which I thought _as good_, that it was
left you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron."	39.7984
"I do not get on at all.	29.5896
Society, I own, is necessary to me.	49.0118
His coming into the country at all, is a
most insolent thing indeed, and I wonder how he could presume to do it.	52.9527
The chief of every day was spent by
him at Lucas Lodge, and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time
to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.	41.8588
my dear Charlotte,--impossible!"	17.4623
Since the ----shire were first quartered in Meryton, nothing but love,
flirtation, and officers, have been in her head.	59.2839
Darcy?--You will never recommend yourself to his friend by
so doing."	63.1461
"Take whatever you like, and get away."	66.6499
how can it affect them?"	54.5205
The colour which had been driven from her face, returned for half a
minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre to
her eyes, as she thought for that space of time, that his affection and
wishes must still be unshaken.	73.6822
"A little."	50.2303
If I wished to think slightingly
of any body's children, it should not be of my own however."	28.2360
"No; but it must be done soon."	32.6526
She
saw herself the object of attention, to tens and to scores of them at
present unknown.	54.8410
"Has your governess left you?"	105.6735
We seem to have been designed for each
other."	24.0316
Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they now felt
that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such
a quarter, than by supposing a partiality for their niece.	73.0891
"But he paid her not the smallest attention, till her grandfather's
death made her mistress of this fortune."	85.6450
He has
children of his own, and may have more.	33.5333
Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and Kitty
begged very hard for a few balls there every winter.	116.1170
She retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked
up and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks
of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt, as made every thing worse.	50.2652
But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness, is a most
natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging.	55.1901
In Three Volumes.	22.8365
CHAPTER XVII.	15.1432
Had it been your uncle's doing, I must and _would_ have
paid him; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own
way.	145.1426
Had she merely _dined_ with him, she might
only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must
remember that four evenings have been also spent together--and four
evenings may do a great deal."	64.8910
But against this, there were objections; and she finally
resolved that it could be the last resource, if her private enquiries as
to the absence of the family, were unfavourably answered.	61.7154
When
     she did come, it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it;
     she made a slight, formal, apology, for not calling before, said
     not a word of wishing to see me again, and was in every respect so
     altered a creature, that when she went away, I was perfectly
     resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer.	49.5034
But
this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently
affected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the
room.	42.1667
I never heard any harm of her; and I dare
say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world.	24.5077
How much you
must have gone through!"	42.1588
Send back your answer as soon as you can,
     and be careful to write explicitly.	115.1531
Elizabeth
had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did
not appear in the least affected by it.	53.7498
Each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their
mother talked on, of her dislike of Mr. Darcy, and her resolution to be
civil to him only as Mr. Bingley's friend, without being heard by either
of them.	56.6377
I shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier.	83.4553
Stay, stay, I will go myself.	52.2131
it is just as he chooses.	25.9503
My conduct may I fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission
from your daughter's lips instead of your own.	123.9573
Maria thought speaking out of the question, and the
gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.	42.7109
The
world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his
high and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chuses to be seen."	70.9751
It was dated
from Rosings, at eight o'clock in the morning, and was as follows:--

     "Be not alarmed, Madam, on receiving this letter, by the
     apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments,
     or renewal of those offers, which were last night so disgusting to
     you.	66.8013
The whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are
on their way to town; and without any intention of coming back again.	47.6908
Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption, while the
servants remained.	54.0220
Mr. Wickham's adieus were much more affectionate than his wife's.	63.4549
Elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character, but said
nothing.	47.2601
"You are severe on us."	29.3589
I am glad
he is gone.	15.9024
"When I wrote that letter," replied Darcy, "I believed myself perfectly
calm and cool, but I am since convinced that it was written in a
dreadful bitterness of spirit."	48.3160
in every view it
is unaccountable!"	49.4003
"Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you
imagine that you are gratifying mine?"	39.3311
Kitty and
Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas, for Mr. Collins was only a
clergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news
to spread at Meryton.	60.9210
"Nothing is more deceitful," said Darcy, "than the appearance of
humility.	33.0034
"That would be a good scheme," said Elizabeth, "if you were sure that
they would not offer to send her home."	28.0474
In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet's visit, and sat about ten
minutes with him in his library.	45.9463
"And which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty?"	112.9471
The visit
was returned in due form.	102.5282
"This is a wretched beginning indeed!	52.9068
I do not like to boast
of my own child, but to be sure, Jane--one does not often see any body
better looking.	46.6949
I am not equal to it.	13.8397
I expected to find a more
reasonable young woman.	59.0748

"He is indeed--but considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza, we
cannot wonder at his complaisance; for who would object to such a
partner?"	53.5368
"But it is," returned she; "for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she
told me all about it."	44.3935
"Why, indeed, he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that
head, as you will hear."	48.5387
Elizabeth at first had rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer
the dining-parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a
pleasanter aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent
reason for what she did, for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have been
much less in his own apartment, had they sat in one equally lively; and
she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement.	73.9184
"It must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a
distance of her own family and friends."	35.2566
Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer;
and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever
dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence.	67.0363
"Yet why did he come?"	48.6309
"I see no occasion for that.	30.8540
The business was therefore soon settled.	47.1045
"But it is fortunate," thought she, "that I have something to wish for.	32.5720
Jane looked well, and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her
spirits, amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt
had reserved for them.	36.2430
She had always seen it with pain; but
respecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of
herself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to
banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation
and decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own
children, was so highly reprehensible.	58.8411
1813.	15.1432
You will not find
him more favourably spoken of by any one."	52.2278
They can
only wish his happiness, and if he is attached to me, no other woman can
secure it."	48.9353
"I can answer your question," said Fitzwilliam, "without applying to
him.	52.6136
If Elizabeth, when Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to
contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of
its contents.	36.8189
It is every way horrible!"	97.6106
It was next to impossible that their cousin should
come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had
received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour.	44.7311
They are gone off together
from Brighton.	26.0217
We know
how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode.	41.5037
To Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligence--Elizabeth had been at
Netherfield long enough.	47.3704
Of his former way of life,
nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself.	55.4112
Elizabeth made no objection;--the door was then allowed to be shut, and
the carriage drove off.	36.7466
for I dare not hope," he continued in a lower and more
serious tone, "that he is improved in essentials."	47.8322
No, Kitty, I have at last learnt to be cautious, and
you will feel the effects of it.	31.9353
She had high
animal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the
attentions of the officers, to whom her uncle's good dinners and her own
easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance.	65.3219
"You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr.	21.1530
This cannot be!	19.3995
"Not the slightest.	40.4068
Mr.
Darcy may hug himself."	28.1794
Mrs. Bennet, we shall have her
at Netherfield at last.'	25.2217
I am going to Gretna Green, and if you cannot guess with
     who, I shall think you a simpleton, for there is but one man in the
     world I love, and he is an angel.	44.7547
She expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject to
each, to be dwelt on farther.	51.6688
"Miss Bennet, do you know who I am?	19.1650
I perfectly comprehend your
feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been.	58.1832
Is it true?"	77.6948
Yes, there was something in _that_; I told you so from the
first, you may remember."	41.0694
If you and Miss
Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very
thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me."	47.9619
"He has been so unlucky as to lose _your_ friendship," replied Elizabeth
with emphasis, "and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all
his life."	37.0588
It was gratitude.--Gratitude, not merely for having once
loved her, but for loving her still well enough, to forgive all the
petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the
unjust accusations accompanying her rejection.	113.3829
I shall not sport with your impatience, by reading what he says
on that point.	45.6005
"It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but their
colour and shape, and the eye-lashes, so remarkably fine, might be
copied."	56.3794
But if you will listen to his letter, you may perhaps be a little
softened by his manner of expressing himself."	46.7077
It is Mr. Wickham's intention to go
     into the regulars; and, among his former friends, there are still
     some who are able and willing to assist him in the army.	63.0142
My mother was in hysterics, and though I endeavoured to
give her every assistance in my power, I am afraid I did not do so much
as I might have done!	27.5808
"What do you mean, Mr. Bennet, by talking in this way?	22.8103
Far be it from me," he presently continued in a voice that marked his
displeasure, "to resent the behaviour of your daughter.	77.3294
I was very
uncomfortable, I may say unhappy.	37.7721
What will you think of my vanity?	32.6086
They stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to
imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and at
first was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it would
be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she made
some slight observation on the dance.	68.2778
She did indeed.	29.6962
_They_ will never be distressed
for money.	27.9493
Lord bless me!	137.5257
On the very day of my coming
     home from Longbourn, your uncle had a most unexpected visitor.	48.8707
And so, I suppose, they often
talk of having Longbourn when your father is dead.	55.3830
Did you see it?"	16.9525
"Did Charlotte dine with you?"	39.0812
I defy even Sir William Lucas
himself, to produce a more valuable son-in-law."	40.8710
A flirt too, in the
worst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond
youth and a tolerable person; and from the ignorance and emptiness of
her mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal
contempt which her rage for admiration will excite.	106.4585
Elizabeth, on her side, had much to do.	25.6121
Sir William staid only a week at Hunsford; but his visit was long enough
to convince him of his daughter's being most comfortably settled, and of
her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met
with.	66.5972
No
aunt, no officers, no news could be sought after;--the very shoe-roses
for Netherfield were got by proxy.	136.1060
"You are joking, Lizzy.	60.8696
It drew from her,
however, the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually
done before; and she asked Bingley, whether he meant to make any stay in
the country at present.	63.0958
I hope we
may often meet again."	30.7472
Lydia,
my love, ring the bell.	46.4738
It was agreed to.	16.0365
"If you were to give me forty such men, I never could be so happy as
you.	29.8826
She knew how little
such a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to
advantage.	63.8918
But we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded bosoms of
each other, the balm of sisterly consolation."	63.6264
"Except," thought Elizabeth, "when she goes to Ramsgate."	45.5035
He
drew a chair near her.	39.3396
Elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it.	39.2483
A military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances have
now made it eligible.	85.9353
When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most pressingly
civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn; and
addressed herself particularly to Mr. Bingley, to assure him how happy
he would make them, by eating a family dinner with them at any time,
without the ceremony of a formal invitation.	66.4518
The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her
story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a
reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon
regained her composure, and calmly replied,

"Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza?--Do you think it incredible
that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman's good opinion,
because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?"	56.4382
"There is some sense in what he says about the girls however; and if he
is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the person to
discourage him."	54.5243
"Oh!"	7.8559
The effect was immediate.	75.4638
The motive professed, was his conviction of its being
     owing to himself that Wickham's worthlessness had not been so well
     known, as to make it impossible for any young woman of character,
     to love or confide in him.	65.7647
Her figure was elegant, and she walked well;--but Darcy, at
whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious.	78.8691
She had turned away, but on hearing herself called, though in
a voice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy, she moved again towards the
gate.	43.9452
In ran Mrs. Bennet to her daughter's room, in her dressing
gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out,

"My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down.	48.8416
"Good gracious!	33.8698
They were certainly no friends to
his acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at, since he might have
chosen so much more advantageously in many respects.	46.4591
What are we to do!"	55.4241
A man of honour could not have doubted the
intention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merely
conditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim
to it by extravagance, imprudence, in short any thing or nothing.	77.3982
had I known what
I ought, what I dared, to do!	65.1050
Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself?"	80.2044
But at length, by Elizabeth's persuasion,
he was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation;
and, after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt, her
resentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity
to see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait on
them at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had
received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the
visits of her uncle and aunt from the city.	48.2240
It has often led him to be liberal and generous,--to give his
money freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve
the poor.	77.8534
The
other is Miss De Bourgh.	27.3954
Long before it had taken place, my opinion of you was
decided.	54.4106
It had given him a
disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town; and
quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a
mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge, where he
could think with pleasure of his own importance, and unshackled by
business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world.	79.1640
"You allude perhaps to the entail of this estate."	73.5651
He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most
intimate, confidential friend.	52.3943
As a clergyman, moreover, I
     feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in
     all families within the reach of my influence; and on these grounds
     I flatter myself that my present overtures of good-will are highly
     commendable, and that the circumstance of my being next in the
     entail of Longbourn estate, will be kindly overlooked on your side,
     and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch.	74.4291
cried Elizabeth, darting from her seat
as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing a
moment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door, it was
opened by a servant, and Mr. Darcy appeared.	43.8574
He has many friends, and he is
at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually
increasing."	96.2836
Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many
people he knew, but _he_ had never seen any thing but affability in her.	42.1902
How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence,
she could not imagine.	54.3680
That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a
ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly
brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate.	94.0001
At present I will not say more, but perhaps
when we are better acquainted----"

He was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each
other.	59.2311
"I am by no means of opinion, I assure you," said he, "that a ball of
this kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people, can
have any evil tendency; and I am so far from objecting to dancing myself
that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins
in the course of the evening, and I take this opportunity of soliciting
yours, Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially,--a
preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right
cause, and not to any disrespect for her."	44.8070
Mrs. Bennet
wondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so much
trouble, and was sure Jane would have caught cold again.--But their
father, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really
glad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle.	61.8202
"Yes, Ma'am, all."	16.7046
"It is no such thing.	30.7348
"And do you impute it to either of those?"	73.0731
There is nothing else to be done.	13.6125
"Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is
believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates."	64.1802
A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing,
dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besides all
this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of
walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word
will be but half deserved."	73.3418
she cried: "This is delightful indeed!--She will
be married!--I shall see her again!--She will be married at sixteen!--My
good, kind brother!--I knew how it would be--I knew he would manage
every thing.	61.3664
"But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in
accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry
elsewhere?"	55.7694
"I am," said he, with a firm voice.	21.0539
There he had talked to her
friends, when he could not to herself.	36.0125
If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form
of encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as
may convince you of its being one."	73.3570
"Aye, there she comes," continued Mrs. Bennet, "looking as unconcerned
as may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at York, provided
she can have her own way.--But I tell you what, Miss Lizzy, if you take
it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way,
you will never get a husband at all--and I am sure I do not know who is
to maintain you when your father is dead.--_I_ shall not be able to keep
you--and so I warn you.--I have done with you from this very day.--I
told you in the library, you know, that I should never speak to you
again, and you will find me as good as my word.	46.9337
At length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind
roused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself.	49.0601
"No, not at all."	32.4902
"_Her_ not objecting, does not justify _him_.	53.8825
1.F.4.	480.1952
"Certainly.	50.0251
"You are quite right.	41.4216
They were soon gone again, rising from
their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise, and
hurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs. Bennet's civilities.	78.4336
"In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure," said Bingley; "and
I hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well."	46.9229
"We never had any governess."	34.6295
Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and
they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put
an end to cards; and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr.
Wickham's attentions.	52.5079
Elizabeth particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter the
preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy, was
hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill
applied.	121.7882
He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman's daughter; so far we are
equal."	56.5285
It became her turn to listen.	68.2468
"I know them a little.	35.6890
Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty, but she smiled too
much.	35.4292
But, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art."	48.9324
CHAPTER XIV.	15.1432
Lord, how ashamed I should be of not
being married before three and twenty!	174.8518
Mrs. Reynolds's respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this
intimation of her knowing her master.	62.2946
"Let me be rightly understood.	39.0776
Why did the Forsters ever let her go out
of their sight?	99.7140
The Gardiners staid a week at Longbourn; and what with the Philipses,
the Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its
engagement.	45.5158
Are the others coming out?"	148.3262
Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their
safe arrival in London; and when she wrote again, Elizabeth hoped it
would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys.	46.5552
"What is his name?"	30.8884
But does not Jane
correspond with the sister?	74.8811
But of every other neglect
I can believe him capable.	56.8020
What do I not
owe you!	44.4782
Nobody wants him to come.	46.3990
I grieve to
     find, however, that Colonel F. is not disposed to depend upon their
     marriage; he shook his head when I expressed my hopes, and said he
     feared W. was not a man to be trusted.	50.4557
said Lydia stoutly, "I am not afraid; for though I _am_ the
youngest, I'm the tallest."	58.8525
This Mrs.
     Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with Wickham; and he
     went to her for intelligence of him, as soon as he got to town.	40.4150

_Engraved for No.	840.8220
But when they see,
as I trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will
learn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again; though we
can never be what we once were to each other."	60.7399
Mr. Collins made his
declaration in form.	57.2112
Elizabeth could hardly help smiling, as she assured her that had not
been the case.	29.8714
You thought the
waiter must not hear, as if he cared!	62.0404
He merely added, that he should not write
again, till he had something of importance to mention."	41.4874
She enquired into Charlotte's domestic
concerns familiarly and minutely, and gave her a great deal of advice,
as to the management of them all; told her how every thing ought to be
regulated in so small a family as her's, and instructed her as to the
care of her cows and her poultry.	53.9203
"I am going
to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows."	29.4202
Did she call to refuse her consent?"	61.6074
"Oh!	7.8559
My
feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them.	48.5909
'Tis as good as a Lord!	75.2749
Let me hear
     from you very soon.	70.5759
She listened most
attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every
expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence,
his taste, or his good manners.	72.7805
They lagged behind, while Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy,
were to entertain each other.	41.5240
what has she to do with it?	46.9561
The observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them
pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected.	64.9034
Jane was by no means better.	27.0114
Such a
change in a man of so much pride, excited not only astonishment but
gratitude--for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and as such
its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as by no means
unpleasing, though it could not be exactly defined.	81.6013
I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced to her
notice, but he certainly has not known her long."	47.4318
"May I ask to what these questions tend?"	203.0871
She is up stairs, and will have great satisfaction in seeing you
all.	27.7591
The possibility of Mr. Collins's fancying himself in love with her
friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two; but
that Charlotte could encourage him, seemed almost as far from
possibility as that she could encourage him herself, and her
astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the
bounds of decorum, and she could not help crying out,

"Engaged to Mr. Collins!	57.9408
His affection was
proved to have been sincere, and his conduct cleared of all blame,
unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his
friend.	59.4752
Darcy?"	45.1040
They came.	27.9492
The darling wish of his
sisters was then gratified; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county
to Derbyshire, and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other source
of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.	52.5719
Our distress, my
     dear Lizzy, is very great.	31.3948
I never heard of her existence till the day before
yesterday."	39.3143
I will have no reserves from _you_."	26.0000
But Mrs. Bennet, who had calculated on
her daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday, which
would exactly finish Jane's week, could not bring herself to receive
them with pleasure before.	64.0426
His understanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but
     a little more liveliness, and _that_, if he marry _prudently_, his
     wife may teach him.	60.8051
"Well, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister," (for Mrs.
Philips first brought her the news.)	52.7337
You have widely mistaken my
character, if you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these.	50.7880
Elizabeth was determined; nor did Sir William at all
shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.	98.5371
"Elizabeth, you are not serious now."	28.7968
He heard her with astonishment.	28.0257
Mr. Wickham's society was of material service in dispelling the gloom,
which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn
family.	76.3824
He was the proudest, most disagreeable man in
the world, and every body hoped that he would never come there again.	37.6552
But if
otherwise, if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or
unnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a
first interview with its object, and even before two words have been
exchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given
somewhat of a trial to the latter method, in her partiality for Wickham,
and that its ill-success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other
less interesting mode of attachment.	83.9055
"You either chuse this method of passing
the evening because you are in each other's confidence and have secret
affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures
appear to the greatest advantage in walking;--if the first, I should be
completely in your way;--and if the second, I can admire you much better
as I sit by the fire."	100.7088
Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance.	109.7262
It had come
with a fare from London; and as he thought the circumstance of a
gentleman and lady's removing from one carriage into another, might be
remarked, he meant to make enquiries at Clapham.	86.8711
He made no answer.	8.2269
In her own past
behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret; and in
the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin.	55.8156

The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly
for denial, and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded, as
having passed at the Netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first
disapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mind
than on hers.	72.4953
"That is very true," replied Elizabeth, "and I could easily forgive
_his_ pride, if he had not mortified _mine_."	26.8036
You will not think of quitting it in a hurry I
hope, though you have but a short lease."	51.5479
Between the
two eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a very particular
regard.	102.8580
They had not been long together, before Darcy told her that Bingley was
also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her
satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when Bingley's quick step
was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room.	52.0095
"Another time, Lizzy," said her mother, "I would not dance with _him_,
if I were you."	20.8516
The party did not supply much conversation.	40.5785
But I suppose you had no opportunity.	20.7640
There was now an interest,
however, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible,
that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four
years old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be
hastily rejected.	49.9748
Though Lydia's short
     letter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand that they were going to
     Gretna Green, something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief
     that W. never intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all, which
     was repeated to Colonel F. who instantly taking the alarm, set off
     from B. intending to trace their route.	94.6621
But enough of this.	70.9592
1813.	15.1432
Mr. Darcy was writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watching
the progress of his letter, and repeatedly calling off his attention by
messages to his sister.	57.6022
On the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when
he speaks.	65.4979
My dear, dear
Lydia!--How merry we shall be together when we meet!"	55.8810
There
are undoubtedly many who could not say the same, but thanks to Lady
Catherine de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding
little matters."	43.0280
"La!	302.5924
Supposing him to be attached to
me, would _my_ refusing to accept his hand, make him wish to bestow it
on his cousin?	80.1299
Her astonishment, however, was
extreme; and continually was she repeating, "Why is he so altered?	65.9966
But, my
     dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do not think me
     obstinate if I still assert, that, considering what her behaviour
     was, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion.	56.4106
He could not speak a word for full ten
minutes.	31.6597
Her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered.	86.7523
And her neighbours at
Lucas lodge, therefore, (for through their communication with the
Collinses, the report she concluded had reached lady Catherine) had only
set _that_ down, as almost certain and immediate, which _she_ had looked
forward to as possible, at some future time.	84.5118
"I should imagine not."	19.6694
The officers may not be so pleasant in General ----'s
regiment."	47.8722

As they passed through the hall,
Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and
drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be decent
looking rooms, walked on.	56.5569
and his sisters are charming women.	39.3772
"My dear Friend,

     "If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa and
     me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our
     lives, for a whole day's tête-à-tête between two women can never
     end without a quarrel.	52.2279
Here consequently was an inexhaustible subject
of discourse.	91.9588
Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment,
before their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly
afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room.	72.1250
Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their behaviour at
the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more
quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and
with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself, she was very
little disposed to approve them.	59.2833
Then addressing her daughter, "Oh!	37.4218
Mrs. Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have
two daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of
the day before, was now high in her good graces.	50.3725
In that case he would return no more.	47.9624
"Mr. Darcy
is impatient to see his sister, and to confess the truth, _we_ are
scarcely less eager to meet her again.	42.1200
"And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real
truth!	179.2762
It is what every body says.	24.3566
what could she mean by
it?	40.6795
My total
ignorance of the connection must plead my apology."	130.9721
I
_should_ say, one of her ladyship's carriages, for she has several."	42.4055
Take your choice, but you must be satisfied
with only one.	34.9675
pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before.	75.4110
You shall not, for the sake of one
individual, change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor
endeavour to persuade yourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and
insensibility of danger, security for happiness."	55.8221
Bingley urged Mr. Jones's being sent for
immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could
be of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most
eminent physicians.	86.2540
Pride relates more to our opinion of
ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us."	119.8955
I
always had a value for him.	28.2684
He listened to her with perfect indifference, while she chose to
entertain herself in this manner, and as his composure convinced her
that all was safe, her wit flowed long.	63.0163
But how little of permanent happiness could
belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions
were stronger than their virtue, she could easily conjecture.	123.6249
cried he.	17.0051
It would be such a delicious scheme,
and I dare say would hardly cost any thing at all.	33.6974
"Yes, I have had a letter from him by express."	44.4761
Kitty and Lydia take
his defection much more to heart than I do.	158.9018
It must be his own doing.--He is his own master.	44.1093
"Don't keep coughing so, Kitty, for heaven's sake!	111.3254
The paling of Rosings Park was their boundary on one side.	55.4074
And with no one to speak to, of what I
felt, no Jane to comfort me and say that I had not been so very weak and
vain and nonsensical as I knew I had!	65.8748
And their
mother had the satisfaction of knowing, that she should be able to shew
her married daughter in the neighbourhood, before she was banished to
the North.	34.1048
They may wish many things besides his
happiness; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they
may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, great
connections, and pride."	96.5039
Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real
occasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not attempt to
oppose it, for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her
tongue before the servants, while they waited at table, and judged it
better that _one_ only of the household, and the one whom they could
most trust, should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the
subject.	53.8877
I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the
     intended elopement, and then Georgiana, unable to support the idea
     of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as
     a father, acknowledged the whole to me.	99.5639

As soon as Jane had read Mr. Gardiner's hope of Lydia's
being soon married, her joy burst forth, and every following sentence
added to its exuberance.	101.4331
"No"--said Darcy, "I have made no such pretension.	43.8245
Bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn;
coming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after
supper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough
detested, had given him an invitation to dinner, which he thought
himself obliged to accept.	73.9467
At length, in a voice of forced calmness, he said,

"And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting!	47.2677
"With all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell it."	88.6012
"And I certainly _never_ shall give it.	32.3456
The dear
colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but Darcy
seemed to feel it most acutely, more I think than last year.	176.1575
He now seated himself by her, and
talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying
at home, of new books and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so
well entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much
spirit and flow, as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself, as
well as of Mr. Darcy.	74.2700
This matter may be
considered, therefore, as finally settled."	75.2459
I do think Mrs. Long is as good
a creature as ever lived--and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls,
and not at all handsome: I like them prodigiously."	99.2971
So high and so conceited that there was no enduring
him!	71.0533
"It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter, with
ease, cannot write ill."

"That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline," cried her
brother--"because he does _not_ write with ease.	65.4929
You are lucky in
having such a master."	49.2704
said he,
as he joined her.	17.3503
But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this
point, as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley's being
withheld from seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude on the subject which
convinced her, on examination, that she did not consider it entirely
hopeless.	45.9695
Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, as
Elizabeth half expected Mr. Bingley to do, he was able to bring Darcy
with him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine's
visit.	72.2405
"Upon my word, Sir," cried Elizabeth, "your hope is rather an
extraordinary one after my declaration.	71.4328
You know how I detest it, unless I am
particularly acquainted with my partner.	39.6458
Perhaps he had been civil, only because he
felt himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his voice, which was
not like ease.	64.4950
Conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her
brain; but she was satisfied with none.	64.3231
A young man, such
as you describe Mr. Bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty girl
for a few weeks, and when accident separates them, so easily forgets
her, that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent."	63.2144
Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade
in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the
honour of knighthood by an address to the King, during his mayoralty.	54.7191
"My father is gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my uncle's
immediate assistance, and we shall be off, I hope, in half an hour.	39.4983
And it is the more to be lamented, because there is reason to
     suppose, as my dear Charlotte informs me, that this licentiousness
     of behaviour in your daughter, has proceeded from a faulty degree
     of indulgence, though, at the same time, for the consolation of
     yourself and Mrs. Bennet, I am inclined to think that her own
     disposition must be naturally bad, or she could not be guilty of
     such an enormity, at so early an age.	46.6087
Lydia does not leave me because she is married;
but only because her husband's regiment happens to be so far off.	57.5442
His choice is disinterested at least,
     for he must know my father can give her nothing.	77.8678
"Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?"	29.3525
"And then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always buying
books."	53.5229
The Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.
Fairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered
throughout numerous locations.	164.9393
Bingley is most unaffectedly modest.	66.2087
How could I
     be so silly as to wish it!	29.2024
The apothecary came, and having
examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught a
violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it;
advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts.	50.5602
He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins,
from a conviction that if they saw him depart, they could not fail to
conjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known
till its success could be known likewise; for though feeling almost
secure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging,
he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday.	68.6887
CHAPTER I.	15.1432
We both know that he has been profligate in every
sense of the word.	34.0853
Wickham's alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated
look; for a few minutes he was silent; till, shaking off his
embarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of
accents,

"You, who so well know my feelings towards Mr. Darcy, will readily
comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume
even the _appearance_ of what is right.	75.7392
Once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but in general
Charlotte wisely did not hear.	124.9144
If she is half as sharp as her mother,
she is saving enough.	42.5502
CHAPTER VIII.	15.1432
Mrs. Bennet could certainly
spare you for another fortnight."	36.2302
The mischief of neglect and
mistaken indulgence towards such a girl.--Oh!	81.4068
"You quite mistook Mr. Darcy.	32.3314
How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more
reasonable, her expressions more moderate!	87.8952
"But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities," replied
her uncle.	30.4142
CHAPTER XIV.	15.1432
There is not a
finer county in England than Derbyshire."	55.6288
When breakfast was over, they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth
began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and
solicitude they shewed for Jane.	62.0742
Mrs. Bennet
was restored to her usual querulous serenity, and by the middle of June
Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without
tears; an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope, that by
the following Christmas, she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to
mention an officer above once a day, unless by some cruel and malicious
arrangement at the war-office, another regiment should be quartered in
Meryton.	65.9431
In seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and oh!	41.8956
In revolving lady Catherine's expressions, however, she could not help
feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting
in this interference.	49.0779
She would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her
husband, called out as she entered the library,

"Oh!	43.1036
The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great
for her to know in what manner she acceded to it.	68.5787
I am so
pleased--so happy.	17.2298
The strangeness of Mr. Collins's making two offers
of marriage within three days, was nothing in comparison of his being
now accepted.	40.5643
When you told Mrs.
Bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield
you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of
panegyric, of compliment to yourself--and yet what is there so very
laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business
undone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else?"	80.9261
"Nay," cried Bingley, "this is too much, to remember at night all the
foolish things that were said in the morning.	55.8729
"You are quite a visit in my debt, Mr. Bingley," she added, "for when
you went to town last winter, you promised to take a family dinner with
us, as soon as you returned.	40.8651
Let us flatter ourselves that _I_ may be the survivor."	58.6135
Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any
extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to the society of
Hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour always pleaded for
allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes--but by everybody else
Mr. Darcy was condemned as the worst of men.	71.4219
They look upon it
quite as their own, I dare say, whenever that happens."	61.9359
My reproofs at Hunsford could not
work such a change as this.	84.8231
"I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect.	39.2992
And who is there, whatever might be
their former conduct, that she would believe capable of such an attempt,
till it were proved against them?	54.6192
She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laught at, and it
was rather too early to begin.	38.5691
Mr.
Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the Longbourn
family; Jane heard them with horror.	71.3335
Poor dear
child!	37.3775
"Your attendance upon her, has been too much for you.	59.0273
"It is _not_ Mr. Bingley," said her husband; "it is a person whom I
never saw in the whole course of my life."	27.1686
His first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade
     her to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her
     friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her,
     offering his assistance, as far as it would go.	51.4759
This was a lucky recollection--it saved her from something like regret.	79.5254
I cannot think of it without abhorrence."	20.0912
They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and her
uncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off by
themselves.	52.1069
But we considered it, we talked of it as impossible.	44.6803
Lord!	49.6754
and having to relate such a thing of
his sister!	52.2976
"And then," said she, "if that very
improbable event should ever take place, I shall merely be able to tell
what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself.	68.1906
"I wish I could say any thing to comfort you," replied Elizabeth; "but
it is wholly out of my power.	35.7444
Mr. Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had
been but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part of
his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and
miserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he
had merely kept the necessary terms, without forming at it any useful
acquaintance.	72.0803
Is there one among the sex, who would not
protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman?	71.7725
Having said thus much, I feel no
     doubt of your secrecy.	45.8686
"If you mean Darcy," cried her brother, "he may go to bed, if he chuses,
before it begins--but as for the ball, it is quite a settled thing; and
as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough I shall send round my
cards."	51.2316
1.E.	414.9544
Nothing was
     to be done that he did not do himself; though I am sure (and I do
     not speak it to be thanked, therefore say nothing about it,) your
     uncle would most readily have settled the whole.	49.4857
Miss
Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish and not well
enough to leave her room.	48.4553
"No indeed; I felt nothing but surprise."	62.7182
Mr. Darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained
wonder, and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him time to speak, replied
with an air of distant civility.	54.8893
Oh!	7.8559
"There is also one other person in the party," he continued after a
pause, "who more particularly wishes to be known to you,--Will you allow
me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance
during your stay at Lambton?"	64.7782
They have not the same
force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression.	48.6556
We have certainly done our best; and most
fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior
society, and from our connection with Rosings, the frequent means of
varying the humble home scene, I think we may flatter ourselves that
your Hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome.	109.4771
"But now that my dear uncle is come, I hope
every thing will be well."	55.0183
1.E.3.	267.3000
"I never heard any thing so
abominable.	22.5723
"Bingley."	23.7899
But then I
have always supposed it to be my own fault--because I would not take the
trouble of practising.	38.9703
Charlotte had seen
them from her husband's room, crossing the road, and immediately running
into the other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding,

"I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility.	54.7061
"Pray tell your sister that I long to see her."	64.4235
While
she spoke, an involuntary glance shewed her Darcy with an heightened
complexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with
confusion, and unable to lift up her eyes.	66.4582
"Yes;--but he seemed to like his second better."	80.5260
Bingley?"	32.6354
"What, none of you?"	49.5360
His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention
would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to
Netherfield.	86.5183
Mr. Bennet made no answer.	8.9936
You have deprived the best years of his life, of that independence
which was no less his due than his desert.	48.5410
She then yawned again, threw aside her book, and
cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement; when hearing
her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly
towards him and said,

"By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at
Netherfield?--I would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult
the wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there are not
some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a
pleasure."	69.4339
"Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at!"	46.3245
There is no knowing how estates
will go when once they come to be entailed."	70.9545
"I know very well, madam," said he, "that when persons sit down to a
card table, they must take their chance of these things,--and happily I
am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object.	49.1290
But no
letter appeared, and she was completely puzzled.	35.0052
By nature inoffensive,
friendly and obliging, his presentation at St. James's had made him
courteous.	82.8168
In short,
I will do my best."	41.1198
It gives me pain
to speak ill of a Darcy.	52.1585
"All!--What, all five out at once?	203.9464
said he; "that is rather singular."	58.4077
"I have found out," said he, "by a singular accident, that there is now
in the room a near relation of my patroness.	46.3696
Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing,
by the servant's account, that their niece was taken suddenly ill;--but
satisfying them instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the
cause of their summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on
the postscript of the last, with trembling energy.--Though Lydia had
never been a favourite with them, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner could not but be
deeply affected.	67.2987
But she is nothing to me now.	29.3685
In the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have
little to fix the attention of a stranger.	50.0380
Elizabeth immediately began playing again.	85.2469
--My mind however is now made up on
     the subject, for having received ordination at Easter, I have been
     so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the Right
     Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh, widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh,
     whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable
     rectory of this parish, where it shall be my earnest endeavour to
     demean myself with grateful respect towards her Ladyship, and be
     ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are
     instituted by the Church of England.	70.1380
Elizabeth obeyed, and running into her own room for her parasol,
attended her noble guest down stairs.	55.3683
Your father would depend on _your_ resolution and
good conduct, I am sure.	40.7636
When I last saw her, she was not very promising.	57.2605
Jane recollected herself soon, and putting the letter away, tried to
join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation; but
Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention
even from Wickham; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave,
than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her up stairs.	91.2849
After sitting
for a moment in silence, she said very stiffly to Elizabeth,

"I hope you are well, Miss Bennet.	34.9897
On the following Monday, Mrs. Bennet had the pleasure of receiving her
brother and his wife, who came as usual to spend the Christmas at
Longbourn.	39.6262
"Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend,
is he?--Poor Eliza!--to be only just _tolerable_."	62.7139
A clergyman like you must marry.--Chuse properly, chuse a
gentlewoman for _my_ sake; and for your _own_, let her be an active,
useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small
income go a good way.	101.3244
But these things happen so often!	78.8756
"I wish it may."	30.4266
"Yes, almost every day."	25.6411
The party then gathered
round the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were
to have on the morrow.	72.3226
Four weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him.	48.8289
"Not yet," replied Jane.	35.7596
"On the evening before my going to London," said he "I made a confession
to him, which I believe I ought to have made long ago.	41.3671
No sooner did he appear, than Elizabeth wisely
resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed;--a resolution the more
necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she
saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them,
and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour
when he first came into the room.	60.9664
Mr. Gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family
prejudice, to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her
master, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his
many merits, as they proceeded together up the great staircase.	73.9650
The pause was to Elizabeth's feelings
dreadful.	65.8259
If your
feelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once.	76.5735
There was too much to
be thought; and felt, and said, for attention to any other objects.	37.4010
"Not at all," he replied; "they were brightened by the exercise."	55.0300
I often
tell young ladies, that no excellence in music is to be acquired,
without constant practice.	85.3764
There was now employment for the whole
party; for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the
beautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches, soon collected
them round the table.	43.6682
Yet he is _such_ a man!"	27.4619
CHAPTER XII.	15.1432
My brother admires her greatly already, he will have
frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing, her
relations all wish the connection as much as his own, and a sister's
partiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most
capable of engaging any woman's heart.	88.2302
He
arranges the business just as he pleases."	84.3555
"Now," said she, "that this first meeting is over, I feel perfectly
easy.	56.1594
Many of my acquaintance are
already there for the winter; I wish I could hear that you, my dearest
friend, had any intention of making one in the croud, but of that I
despair.	76.2786
She was very wrong in singling me out as
     she did; I can safely say, that every advance to intimacy began on
     her side.	45.2050
_I_ should be
ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me."	46.4220
Very odd!--And you only the
second.--The younger ones out before the elder are married!--Your
younger sisters must be very young?"	140.3576
That they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness,
and wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice!	82.2261
Lydia
talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the
fish she had won, and Mr. Collins, in describing the civility of Mr. and
Mrs. Philips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses
at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing
that he crouded his cousins, had more to say than he could well manage
before the carriage stopped at Longbourn House.	73.6189
My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness, and I
confess that I did not expect to receive _more_ than my due."	56.4965
Lady Catherine it
appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings,
for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr.
Darcy.	68.2419
But I dare not
hope it.	21.0898
"I thank you for my share of the favour," said Elizabeth; "but I do not
particularly like your way of getting husbands."	40.9988
"You are uniformly charming!"	53.9646
Is _her_ husband, is the son of
his late father's steward, to be his brother?	34.3956
Nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and while able to
suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was
ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very
sincerely wish him happy.	71.8894
Scarcely a syllable was
uttered that did not relate to the game, except when Mrs. Jenkinson
expressed her fears of Miss De Bourgh's being too hot or too cold, or
having too much or too little light.	81.1533
"If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy," cried a young Lucas who came with his
sisters, "I should not care how proud I was.	46.5361
Young ladies have great penetration in such matters
as these; but I think I may defy even _your_ sagacity, to discover the
name of your admirer.	76.0004
To this, Mary very gravely replied, "Far be it from me, my dear sister,
to depreciate such pleasures.	65.5447
And now do, when you get to town, find them out,
wherever they may be; and if they are not married already, _make_ them
marry.	69.6414
"I dare say you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that you
would be gone with such celerity.	26.4987
Elizabeth privately added, "And how much I shall have to conceal."	37.1667
I _will_ read you the passage which
particularly hurts me.	101.1905
With the mention of Derbyshire, there were many ideas connected.	57.1287
"My dear Mr. Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome!	23.1894
Teaze calmness of temper and presence of mind!	151.7959
And there are other
circumstances which I am not at liberty--which it is not worth while to
relate; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless.	104.8002
CHAPTER VI.	15.1432
"I hope, my dear," said Mr. Bennet to his wife, as they were at
breakfast the next morning, "that you have ordered a good dinner to-day,
because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party."	31.3571
Bingley.--But--good
lord!	67.4838
People _did_ say,
you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope
it is not true.	43.4142
Jane met her with a smile of
such sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently
marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the
evening.--Elizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that moment
solicitude for Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and every thing
else gave way before the hope of Jane's being in the fairest way for
happiness.	66.0261
"You are too hasty, Sir," she cried.	51.2635
His family knew him to be on all common occasions, a most negligent and
dilatory correspondent, but at such a time, they had hoped for exertion.	60.1572
GARDINER."	55.4642
One must speak a little, you know.	53.6685
I know that you could be neither happy nor
respectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband; unless you looked
up to him as a superior.	58.3089
I must speak to Hill, this moment."	35.7022
CHAPTER XI.	15.1432
First, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the
present occasion; and secondly, of my room.	59.2602
Interested people have perhaps
misrepresented each to the other.	195.0019
Nothing occurred between
them that could justify the hopes of his sister.	58.3122
"What think you of books?"	102.3874
It is very often nothing but
our own vanity that deceives us.	69.9028
The same anxiety to get them by themselves, was visible again in the
evening.	34.4528
I know you will do him such ample justice, that I am
growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent.	52.8037
But do you think she
would be prevailed on to go back with us?	25.3238
In the desperation
of her feelings she resolved on one effort more; and, turning to
Elizabeth, said,

"Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a
turn about the room.--I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting
so long in one attitude."	54.7385
"How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains!	106.5873
I shall send this by
     express, that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer.	69.6472

Charlotte's first letters
were received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be
curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would
like Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to
be; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt that Charlotte
expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen.	69.9650
As for your Elizabeth's picture, you must not attempt to have it
taken, for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?"	66.7375
Towards _him_ I have been
kinder than towards myself."	89.9044
She practises very constantly."	42.2813
I have met with two instances lately; one I will not mention;
the other is Charlotte's marriage.	62.3842
Mr. Collins
received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then
proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result
of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the
refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow
from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character.	72.3928
The more I see
of the world, the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms
my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the
little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit
or sense.	89.9102
As soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively, and
shook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good information;
and he soon afterwards said aloud, "Mr. Bennet, have you no more lanes
hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to-day?"	67.0525
With assumed tranquillity he then replied, "I have no wish of denying
that I did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your
sister, or that I rejoice in my success.	61.4437
Every thing nourishes what is
strong already.	119.8954
Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ to visit
him, if you do not."	22.8500
Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a
private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before.	43.8737
"I have just had a letter from
Jane, with such dreadful news.	43.3709
"It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire.	31.4135
You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand your
     attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but I
     demand it of your justice.	56.5645
I have faults enough,
but they are not, I hope, of understanding.	34.0164
I will
think no more about him."	27.5343
When that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth
for the indulgence of some music.	42.7614
If such goodness does not make her miserable now,
she will never deserve to be happy!	70.9045
Mr. Gardiner declared his
willingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation.	31.3441
You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its _being
created_."	37.3374
Her thoughts were all fixed on that
one spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy then
was.	59.7239
No one made any reply.	54.5779
In Three Volumes.	22.8365

She blushed at the very idea; and
thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt, than to run
such a risk.	55.7456
Her mother's thoughts
she plainly saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to
venture near her, lest she might hear too much.	82.0601
"To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of
either."	67.0591
"I almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would be too much
for me, or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle.	62.5573
"And till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you entertained a
doubt, I suppose, of their being really married?"	53.0659
Elizabeth could never
address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over,
and, though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the
sake of what had been, rather than what was.	72.0907
His
ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their
evening party; and he bore with the ill-judged officiousness of the
mother, and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command
of countenance, particularly grateful to the daughter.	111.3656
1.E.9.	214.7270
what hours of transport we shall spend!	131.0592
He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration
should _now_ escape him, nothing that could elevate her with the hope of
influencing his felicity; sensible that if such an idea had been
suggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight
in confirming or crushing it.	101.6039
though I
thought it would be very good fun if I was."	43.2093
Does your
charge give you much trouble?	103.1107
"No, she would go home.	26.8500
She had a sister married to a Mr. Philips, who had been a clerk to their
father, and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in
London in a respectable line of trade.	46.0472
This son was to join
in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow
and younger children would by that means be provided for.	60.7229
She could not imagine what business he could have in town
so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that
he might be always flying about from one place to another, and never
settled at Netherfield as he ought to be.	43.1334
"I hope," added Mrs. Gardiner, "that no consideration with regard to
this young man will influence her.	49.3395
"Can you come to-morrow?"	29.7792
Elizabeth could not but look surprised.	42.1498
Elizabeth almost stared at her.--"Can this be Mr.	95.4333
To Mrs. Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording pleasure,
unconnected with his general powers.	82.7535
Louisa and I were agreeing that we
should not have known her again."	59.7345
He answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped.	54.7805
Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his manners
were always so pleasing, that had his character and his marriage been
exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he
claimed their relationship, would have delighted them all.	84.9595
She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man, who, in
disposition and talents, would most suit her.	59.4455
"He is as fine a fellow," said Mr. Bennet, as soon as they were out of
the house, "as ever I saw.	22.4533
Mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but
she could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no
longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters' beauty and her own,
it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without
much reluctance.	72.3806
How well
it sounds.	43.4007
Elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival, that Mr. Darcy
was expected there in the course of a few weeks, and though there were
not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer, his coming would
furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and
she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley's designs on him
were, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently destined
by Lady Catherine; who talked of his coming with the greatest
satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and
seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by
Miss Lucas and herself.	59.3202
The whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round
the other table, and Mr. Collins took his station between his cousin
Elizabeth and Mrs.	78.6907
Lady Lucas began directly to calculate with more
interest than the matter had ever excited before, how many years longer
Mr. Bennet was likely to live; and Sir William gave it as his decided
opinion, that whenever Mr. Collins should be in possession of the
Longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife
should make their appearance at St. James's.	52.1380
There is not one of his tenants or servants but what will
give him a good name.	39.5405
Miss Bennet was therefore
established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt authorised by such
commendation to think of her as he chose.	62.4369
But to be candid without ostentation or design--to take the good
of every body's character and make it still better, and say nothing of
the bad--belongs to you alone.	64.9046
Your's, &c."

Mr. Darcy's letter to Lady Catherine, was in a different style; and
still different from either, was what Mr. Bennet sent to Mr. Collins, in
reply to his last.	52.9196
certainly," said Elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; "we will
ask you no questions."	49.6478
Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded
of her sister's ready acquiescence.	40.8335
"Did you go by the village of Kympton?"	52.3728
"By all means," cried Bingley; "let us hear all the particulars, not
forgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have more
weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of.	66.0193
I am sincerely grieved for him and
     Mrs. F. but no one can throw any blame on them.	60.1524
Jane looked a little
paler than usual, but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected.	70.7295
I
never was.	26.5741
I will write to my sister Gardiner about
them directly.	53.7514
I am confident that she would have performed
delightfully.	31.5392
"Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep
in mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been let down to
hide it, not doing its office."	94.0761
The first week of their return was soon gone.	58.4866
"I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and when
your sister is recovered, you shall if you please name the very day of
the ball.	34.3602
If I may so express it, he has a _right_
to be proud."	54.4251
Mrs. Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy's delight, when she should enter
the room.	40.6599
She received him with
her very best politeness, which he returned with as much more,
apologising for his intrusion, without any previous acquaintance with
her, which he could not help flattering himself however might be
justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to
her notice.	61.3895
See paragraph 1.E below.	100.0120
"Oh!	7.8559
She went on.	33.1775
I dearly love a
laugh."	79.7702
The introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their
relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore
it; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he
could from such disgraceful companions.	69.2804
susceptibility to her feelings; which are
naturally lively enough.	99.9500
"Is that his design in settling here?"	86.8549
But Mrs.
Bennet, was not so well pleased with it.	19.3263
"Let me write for you," said Jane, "if you dislike the trouble
yourself."	29.5201
The very last evening was spent
there; and her Ladyship again enquired minutely into the particulars of
their journey, gave them directions as to the best method of packing,
and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right
way, that Maria thought herself obliged, on her return, to undo all the
work of the morning, and pack her trunk afresh.	65.6955
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.	96.8678
This was spoken jestingly, but it appeared to her so just a picture of
Mr. Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer; and,
therefore, abruptly changing the conversation, talked on indifferent
matters till they reached the parsonage.	49.5701
Charlotte is an
excellent manager, I dare say.	28.3837
"I wonder," said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, "whether he is
likely to be in this country much longer."	32.9764
"Nor I, I am sure," said Miss Bingley.	15.5911

His being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living
but three miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation;
and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of
Jane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as
she could do.	56.3002
Elizabeth looked
expressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw any thing of
which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued, "Oh!	56.8596
Mamma would like to
go too of all things!	135.3929
He owns it
himself without disguise."	94.3658
Their other engagements were few; as the style of living of
the neighbourhood in general, was beyond the Collinses' reach.	75.5463
yes.	21.2462
It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.	175.0229
Mrs. Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus employed
Elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books
that lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr. Darcy's eyes were fixed
on her.	56.3606
Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins, she thought
with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure.	63.6039
Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting, that had
she chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to her, as her
future niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of what her
ladyship's indignation would have been.	60.8931
Away ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech.	110.1689
"Eliza Bennet," said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her, "is
one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other
sex, by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I dare say, it
succeeds.	44.5362
She wanted to hear of him, when there
seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence.	40.3347
Had I but explained some part of it only--some part of what
I learnt, to my own family!	100.4107
"Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight.	44.4601
But the
clothes, the wedding clothes!	66.7196
Kitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time with
her two elder sisters.	63.8997
*       *       *       *       *

It may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be added
to their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting subject, by
its repeated discussion, no other could detain them from it long, during
the whole of the journey.	75.5530
Darcy, you must allow
me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner.--You
cannot refuse to dance, I am sure, when so much beauty is before you."	49.7376
But Mr. Bennet was not of a
disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own
imprudence had brought on, in any of those pleasures which too often
console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice.	89.4404
When a woman has
five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own
beauty."	66.6193
CHAPTER XVIII.	15.1432
Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.	85.3944
But he is a
liberal master, I suppose, and _that_ in the eye of a servant
comprehends every virtue."	43.2486
Mrs. Gardiner and
her niece, however, did her justice, and pitied her.	27.3206
But, if I were you, I would stand by the nephew.	46.7376
Her favourite walk, and where
she frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, was
along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was
a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and
where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine's curiosity.	57.5294
It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline's
interested wishes, and she could not for a moment suppose that those
wishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man
so totally independent of every one.	95.4742
Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed?	126.0425
His regiment is there; for I suppose you
have heard of his leaving the ----shire, and of his being gone into the
regulars.	47.6487
He
_was_ coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had
any idea of their not being gone to Scotland: when that apprehension
first got abroad, it hastened his journey."	88.5587
"Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her.	46.8515
Not handsome enough to dance with!	47.5091
She was less handsome than her brother, but there
was sense and good humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly
unassuming and gentle.	40.6946
When those dances
were over she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with
her, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy, who took
her so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without
knowing what she did, she accepted him.	56.7264
You know not, you
can scarcely conceive, how they have tortured me;--though it was some
time, I confess, before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice."	55.5538
But now it was all too natural.	60.3930
But to be sure,
the good lady who shewed us the house, did give him a most flaming
character!	73.5106
If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill
from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and
it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the
dark.	72.1096
My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of
thinking.	55.0944
I
hope he will overlook it.	31.8365
But of this answer Lydia heard not a word.	62.2390
My avowed one, or what I avowed to
myself, was to see whether your sister were still partial to Bingley,
and if she were, to make the confession to him which I have since made."	69.8021
When they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria's alarm was every
moment increasing, and even Sir William did not look perfectly
calm.--Elizabeth's courage did not fail her.	56.3804
It would have spared her, she thought,
one sleepless night out of two.	47.8048
Her coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged
thing in the world!	57.3665
He answered
me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying,
that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine's discernment as to be
certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily.	49.8270
"Oh!	7.8559
"You must not be too severe upon yourself," replied Elizabeth.	26.7572
"That is a question which I hardly know how to answer.	23.4943
They entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a while,
ascended some of the higher grounds; whence, in spots where the opening
of the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of
the valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods
overspreading many, and occasionally part of the stream.	100.4417

She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.	79.7516
I cannot forget the follies and vices of
others so soon as I ought, nor their offences against myself.	52.2365
"Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way?	33.7254
Family pride, and _filial_ pride, for he is very proud of what
his father was, have done this.	63.6818
Elizabeth smiled.	14.4349
I was right, therefore; my last letter had never reached her.	47.4300
The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn.	52.3472
Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal
people in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance,
was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one
himself at Netherfield.	62.6230
The rain continued the whole evening without intermission;
Jane certainly could not come back.	61.8533
Lydia's being settled in the
North, just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her
company, for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in
Hertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and besides, it was such a
pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted
with every body, and had so many favourites.	63.1427
His temptation is
not adequate to the risk."	44.6459
But here, she did injustice to the fire and independence of his
character, for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next
morning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw
himself at her feet.	70.5494
Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at piquet, and
Mrs. Hurst was observing their game.	44.6614
"My dear Madam," he replied, "this invitation is particularly
gratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and you
may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as
possible."	39.7810
She got up, and ran out of the room;
and returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall to
the dining-parlour.	51.3415
It is natural that obligation should be
felt, and if I could _feel_ gratitude, I would now thank you.	52.0564
Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy.	71.7478
Mrs. Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her
Derbyshire friend, that had attended her from that part of the world.	58.4058
But in an instant arose the
dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for Mr. Darcy's
pleasure in the Bingleys' invitation to the officers; and though this
was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was
pronounced by his friend Mr. Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied, and
who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business
the day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant
smile,

"I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, if
he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here."	54.4768
This is your final resolve!	102.0396
I know not in what manner, under what form of
     falsehood he has imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to
     be wondered at.	59.8723
Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most
accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been
fortunate enough to be never without partners, which was all that they
had yet learnt to care for at a ball.	48.1258
The prospect of such
delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits.	41.8145
Mrs. Gardiner's caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on
the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone; after
honestly telling her what she thought, she thus went on:

"You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely because you
are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of speaking
openly.	60.7601
Forgive
me; and if you persist in indifference, do not make _me_ your
confidante."	74.3654
And when
the party entered the assembly room, it consisted of only five
altogether; Mr. Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and
another young man.	59.3515
"She had better have stayed at home," cried Elizabeth; "perhaps she
_meant_ well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see too
little of one's neighbours.	58.6008
Elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her
father's behaviour as a husband.	27.4704
With amazement did
she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power;
and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to
give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal.	64.4769
Elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from
Jane, on their first arrival at Lambton; and this disappointment had
been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; but
on the third, her repining was over, and her sister justified by the
receipt of two letters from her at once, on one of which was marked that
it had been missent elsewhere.	64.9526
"The _present_ always occupies you in such scenes--does it?"	199.9980
"Lizzy," said he, "what are you doing?	24.7957
"Yes--_that_ is what makes it amusing.	40.2649
His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling."	54.5936
Yet in spite of all these temptations, let me warn my cousin
Elizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur, by a precipitate
closure with this gentleman's proposals, which, of course, you will be
inclined to take immediate advantage of."	70.2602
These two girls had been above an hour in the place, happily
employed in visiting an opposite milliner, watching the sentinel on
guard, and dressing a sallad and cucumber.	81.9182
When she remembered the style of his address,
she was still full of indignation; but when she considered how unjustly
she had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against
herself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion.	71.5180
I was told, that not only your
sister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that
_you_, that Miss Elizabeth Bennet, would, in all likelihood, be soon
afterwards united to my nephew, my own nephew, Mr. Darcy.	77.0412
"Why will you think so?	37.4620
"Mrs. Collins, you must send a servant with them.	31.1868
what is it about?	38.4745
I scarcely know any one who cannot do all this, and I am sure I
never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without being
informed that she was very accomplished."	45.1036
I shall write again as soon as any
     thing more is determined on.	43.7009
"Your's sincerely, &c."

Miss Bingley's congratulations to her brother, on his approaching
marriage, were all that was affectionate and insincere.	57.5011
At present I am not in love with
Mr. Wickham; no, I certainly am not.	41.9905
Mary, however, continued to console herself with such
kind of moral extractions from the evil before them.	50.6770
But, perhaps he could not in her mother's
presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt.	49.4511
"I have sent for
you on an affair of importance.	50.4447
They owed the restoration of Lydia, her character, every thing
to him.	32.4745
If Mr. Darcy is neither by
honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make
another choice?	69.7364
nonsense, how can you talk so!	61.2270
It is on your account that he has been
so frequently invited this week.	43.0886
It is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and
interest, for him to be guilty of it.	43.6432
Absence had increased her desire of seeing
Charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins.	75.5805
She was a woman of mean understanding,
little information, and uncertain temper.	62.0456
But, however, he is very welcome to
come to Netherfield, if he likes it.	30.2722
If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.	48.5944
Elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with
indignation.	30.8073
There is
one point, on which I want your advice.	34.7477
I see the imprudence
of it.--Oh!	28.2330
I have suspected it some time, but
I am now convinced."	31.7506
About ten or a dozen years ago,
before her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in that very part
of Derbyshire, to which he belonged.	89.2699
"Mr. Collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife."	69.5846
"It is difficult indeed--it is distressing.--One does not know what to
think."	42.1175
The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground.	55.2640
The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this
conversation passed, by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom
they had been speaking; Mr. Bingley and his sisters came to give their
personal invitation for the long expected ball at Netherfield, which was
fixed for the following Tuesday.	65.4109
you are a great deal too apt you know, to like people in general.	36.9076
The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw.	76.9623
And accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the Parsonage
together.	77.2200
She cared for none
     of her friends, she wanted no help of his, she would not hear of
     leaving Wickham.	42.6358
They called at various times of the morning, sometimes
separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their
aunt.	69.9870
Poor little Lizzy!	75.2006
On the contrary every particular relative
to his sister, was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself; and
if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct, who
will believe me?	43.6434
But, really, I know not what to say.	51.5234
Again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an
expression of mingled incredulity and mortification.	57.0294
Kitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry.	58.3985
The wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from
the church door, and every body had as much to say or to hear on the
subject as usual.	65.4157
When she thought
of her mother indeed, her confidence gave way a little, but she would
not allow that any objections _there_ had material weight with Mr.
Darcy, whose pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from
the want of importance in his friend's connections, than from their want
of sense; and she was quite decided at last, that he had been partly
governed by this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of
retaining Mr. Bingley for his sister.	49.4507
But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence.	135.4622
She read over her aunt's commendation of him
again and again.	57.0305
said he,
with a look of doubt.	19.3111

But it is so
strange!"	16.2054
She has the
reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe
she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from
her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride of her nephew, who
chuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of
the first class."	61.3259
Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew;
and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character, in
her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him
language so very abusive, especially of Elizabeth, that for some time
all intercourse was at an end.	64.7011
And now nothing
remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the
violence of my affection.	54.3820
You are not going to be _Missish_, I
hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report.	31.8945
Sometime hence it will be all found out, and then we
may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before.	86.7327
I promised
them so faithfully!	102.0508
I am
afraid you will be angry."	12.8365
Elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the
compliment must be all for herself.	61.6226
Consider Mr. Collins's respectability, and
Charlotte's prudent, steady character.	48.1106
The
latter was thinking only of his breakfast.	74.6258
Colonel Forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would
be necessary to clear his expences at Brighton.	41.6161
The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every
female of the family.	35.6903
No,
no--I feel he may defy us there.	93.6842
Instead of
viewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my own, and
welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt.--But no,"--recollecting
herself,--"that could never be: my uncle and aunt would have been lost
to me: I should not have been allowed to invite them."	44.7332
Elizabeth, construing all
this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased; and on
this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their visitors
left them, capable of considering the last half hour with some
satisfaction, though while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been
little.	63.1145
said he, taking the letter from
his pocket; "but perhaps you would like to read it."	48.9716
It is really too distressing.	29.2662
"But, my dear Elizabeth," she added, "what sort of girl is Miss King?	38.3259
I shall see her in January.	26.2429
Had Lydia's marriage been
concluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that
Mr. Darcy would connect himself with a family, where to every other
objection would now be added, an alliance and relationship of the
nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned.	79.8937
"Implacable resentment
_is_ a shade in a character.	112.8858
"What you ask," said Elizabeth, "is no sacrifice on my side; and Mr.
Darcy had much better finish his letter."	37.2640
Consider how important every moment is, in such a case."	76.9284
"I certainly shall not.	17.6018
And there was my
aunt, all the time I was dressing, preaching and talking away just as if
she was reading a sermon.	67.2457
That _she_ could
be in any danger from the deception never entered my head.	60.6814
He took the hint, and soon began with, "This seems a very comfortable
house.	47.4725
how rich
and how great you will be!	73.2689
The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia,
depended less on any single event, or any particular person, for though
they each, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr.
Wickham, he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and
a ball was at any rate, a ball.	75.9823
"I am sorry, exceedingly sorry," replied Darcy, in a tone of surprise
and emotion, "that you have ever been informed of what may, in a
mistaken light, have given you uneasiness.	46.3883
The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the
Lucas's last week; and even Mr. Darcy acknowledged, that the partridges
were remarkably well done; and I suppose he has two or three French
cooks at least.	75.4573
He was
angry.	16.8925
Let her go then.	39.2805
In Lydia's imagination, a visit to Brighton comprised
every possibility of earthly happiness.	76.1643
She mentioned this to her friend Miss
Lucas.	48.3745
I am sorry to pain you--but so it was.	30.3144
do any thing rather than
marry without affection.	85.2353
The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object of
her wishes, since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of
accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those
attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and
servants.	58.9716
She smiled, but made no answer.	15.1119
Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare.	44.1920
"And that," said Mrs. Reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures,
"is my master--and very like him.	64.8608
And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?"	43.9062
"You are over scrupulous surely.	89.7059
Did he know of
their intending to go off?	46.6408
With
these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted!	125.5386
With a stronger voice she soon added, "I have this comfort immediately,
that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it
has done no harm to any one but myself."	65.6964
At length however Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who
had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no
likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken.	55.1760
There was also a postscript to this
effect.	44.6345
"And pray
may I ask?"	62.5559
"There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular
evil, a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome."	83.0071
She will follow wherever Lydia leads.	43.0482
The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most
remarkable charm of the young lady, to whom he was now rendering himself
agreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in his case than
in Charlotte's, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence.	62.0632
"You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew!	38.8617
Well, but now for
my news: it is about dear Wickham; too good for the waiter, is not it?	101.2536
"How can you contrive to write so even?"	93.1387
I owe all that I know
of it, to another, not to you."	56.0938
Her keenest attention was awakened; she longed to hear more,
and was grateful to her uncle for saying,

"There are very few people of whom so much can be said.	61.7587
"Oh!--you mean Jane, I suppose--because he danced with her twice.	36.0868

"And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters
behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the
winter is over."	49.3751
No principle of either,
would be violated by my marriage with Mr. Darcy.	40.2954
After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows,
to admire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to point out its
beauties, and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much
better worth looking at in the summer.	47.6238
His complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance of
his mind was visible in every feature.	59.5886
My
father, however, is partial to Mr. Wickham.	19.1299
"But surely," said she, "I may enter his county with impunity,
and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me."	69.1496
"There has
been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way.	37.2804
Her sister made not the smallest objection, and the piano-forte was
opened, and Darcy, after a few moments recollection, was not sorry for
it.	45.9483
Miss Bennet, I insist on being satisfied.	23.5455
When Mr. Collins could be
forgotten, there was really a great air of comfort throughout, and by
Charlotte's evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must be often
forgotten.	53.7277
This roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of being
eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once.	79.7324
There is no talk of his
coming to Netherfield again in the summer; and I have enquired of every
body too, who is likely to know."	40.1250
Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and
that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time.	52.6236
Their society can afford no pleasure,
that will atone for such wretchedness as this!	106.5991
She had no fear of its spreading farther, through his means.	49.6526
"Most willingly."	76.5397
When she is secure of him, there will be leisure for falling
in love as much as she chuses."	31.5771
They could
not be untouched by his politeness, and had they drawn his character
from their own feelings, and his servant's report, without any reference
to any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known,
would not have recognised it for Mr. Darcy.	49.5102
Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand.	40.4460
They have each their
advantages, and I can be equally happy in either."	50.2108
Elizabeth's mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired
every remarkable spot and point of view.	69.0255
Miss Bingley's civility to Elizabeth increased at last
very rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane; and when they parted,
after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to
see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her most
tenderly, she even shook hands with the former.--Elizabeth took leave of
the whole party in the liveliest spirits.	51.3930
*       *       *       *       *

In the evening, soon after Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library, she saw
Mr. Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was
extreme.	52.9465
"If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I shall know
what to think."	36.5681
I am sorry to have occasioned pain to any
one.	33.3007
I don't know.	14.9295
"In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as quitting that
sphere.	27.2497
I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such
a way."	38.1109
It settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed
circuit; which brought them again, after some time, in a descent among
hanging woods, to the edge of the water, in one of its narrowest parts.	84.7077
In spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her
feelings, in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could easily
perceive that her spirits were affected by it.	31.6464
They had frequently been staying with her in town.	37.1745
"Mary and Kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in every
fatigue, I am sure, but I did not think it right for either of them.	37.5218
"Write to me very often, my dear."	59.1656
I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and
will save all the best of the covies for you."	28.3094
Now what have you to say?"	49.8737
You do not
know what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in
such terms."	49.1874
After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two
gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to the
brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious
water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration.	79.5058
Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, "Yes, you know enough of
my _frankness_ to believe me capable of _that_.	48.4772
Section  2.	67.7426
If he fears me, why come hither?	216.2168
"Certainly, Sir;--and it has the advantage also of being in vogue
amongst the less polished societies of the world.--Every savage can
dance."	96.2038
I told him of
all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs,
absurd and impertinent.	51.9651
"What did you say of me, that I did not deserve?	18.9173
Her manners were
pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride and impertinence;
she had no conversation, no style, no taste, no beauty.	49.3109
"Oh, Lizzy!	21.1518
"She is happy, then," said her father, drily; "and her residence there
will probably be of some duration."	47.6476
She related the subject
of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the
furniture, in vain.	29.8582
For God's sake, say no more of
his partners.	66.9023
She had dressed with more than
usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all
that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than
might be won in the course of the evening.	42.5958
thought she.	46.2891
As he said this, she could easily see that he had no doubt of
a favourable answer.	44.2916
I thought him very sly;--he hardly ever
     mentioned your name.	67.9560
Mrs. Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes
conversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; with
tears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villanous
conduct of Wickham, and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage;
blaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the
errors of her daughter must be principally owing.	93.3871
Let us hope for
better things.	46.9773
It was a rational scheme to be sure!	21.9313
But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr. Wickham, when
she read with somewhat clearer attention, a relation of events, which,
if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which
bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself, her feelings
were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition.	72.5948
is not this an agreeable surprise?"	74.9221
"Good heavens!"	61.3224
Though her manner
varied however, her determination never did.	116.7606
Accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid
whether Pemberley were not a very fine place, what was the name of its
proprietor, and with no little alarm, whether the family were down for
the summer.	65.6615
Mrs. Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy, drawn
when she was only eight years old.	48.1421
"FITZWILLIAM DARCY."	112.6393
With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally
surprised to find that he meditated a quick return.	126.2309
I must conclude, for I cannot be
     long from my poor mother.	41.2628
Upon the whole, therefore, she found, what has been
sometimes found before, that an event to which she had looked forward
with impatient desire, did not in taking place, bring all the
satisfaction she had promised herself.	70.0397
Their parties
abroad were less varied than before; and at home she had a mother and
sister whose constant repinings at the dulness of every thing around
them, threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though Kitty
might in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers
of her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition
greater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her
folly and assurance, by a situation of such double danger as a watering
place and a camp.	92.0746
What praise is more valuable than the praise
of an intelligent servant?	97.5249
"But the wife of Mr.
Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily
attached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause
to repine."	60.5571
The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture suitable
to the fortune of their proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with admiration
of his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of
splendor, and more real elegance, than the furniture of Rosings.	81.9816
Her performance on the piano-forte is
exquisite."	88.7264
I never saw such a long chin in my life.	29.2086
"Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family," said Elizabeth,
coolly, "will be rather a confirmation of it; if, indeed, such a report
is in existence."	47.4672
At our time of life, it is not so
pleasant I can tell you, to be making new acquaintance every day; but
for your sakes, we would do any thing.	61.6974
It
was, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own
wishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved
him, as now, when all love must be vain.	51.2857
But so they always are.	85.6994
I have written to Colonel Forster, to inform him of
     our present arrangements, and to request that he will satisfy the
     various creditors of Mr. Wickham in and near Brighton, with
     assurances of speedy payment, for which I have pledged myself.	55.3666
There was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth's mind, a more gentle
sensation towards the original, than she had ever felt in the height of
their acquaintance.	53.1647
No motive can
excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_.	108.6708
She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of
admiration to so great a man; and yet that he should look at her because
he disliked her, was still more strange.	49.1375
"My dear," replied her husband, "I have two small favours to request.	23.5513
how unlucky!	45.2618
But do not be cast down.	34.3875
If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.	129.0524
It was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so early
as to be in Gracechurch-street by noon.	50.7289
You shewed me how insufficient were all my
pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased."	88.2262
For the last week they had seen very little
of either Lady Catherine or her daughter.	51.2757
Of
this she was perfectly unaware;--to her he was only the man who made
himself agreeable no where, and who had not thought her handsome enough
to dance with.	77.3636
"One of them does."	56.4677
She has known him only a fortnight.	32.6078
I assure
you that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with
myself, I should not pay him half so much deference.	39.9395
The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents,
about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.	45.9326
She still cherished a
very tender affection for Bingley.	48.0588
How could I ever be foolish enough to
expect a renewal of his love?	49.7253
But the morrow
passed off much better than she expected; for Mrs. Bennet luckily stood
in such awe of her intended son-in-law, that she ventured not to speak
to him, unless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or mark
her deference for his opinion.	67.0780
Her answer was warmly in his favour.	35.8708
My poor father!	40.1488
She accounted for it, however, by supposing that
her last letter to her friend from Longbourn, had by some accident been
lost.	69.2637
Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs. Bennet, and they
gave way only to the greater distress of Mr. Bingley's continued
absence.	50.2724
And yet, upon my honour, I
believed what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this
moment.	47.8314
1.E.7.	256.5478
"There were some very strong objections against the lady," were Colonel
Fitzwilliam's words, and these strong objections probably were, her
having one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in
business in London.	87.8284
"To-morrow fortnight."	68.6726
If you are a good
girl for the next ten years, I will take you to a review at the end of
them."	38.1562
Her brother's recommendation was enough to ensure her favour: his
judgment could not err, and he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth, as
to leave Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than
lovely and amiable.	70.9849
His countenance, voice, and manner, had
established him at once in the possession of every virtue.	50.4556
Those who chose to be
idle, certainly might."	71.3710
She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse, but
she could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and
cold was their manner, whenever they did.	55.7750
Heaven and earth!--of what
are you thinking?	123.3956
Yes, yes.	18.2894
I send no compliments to your
mother.	27.9942
This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we
     have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject
     it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty
     towards Mr. Wickham.	50.8946
"How despicably have I acted!"	113.8819
I.	40.2606
They were in ----
     street.	28.3132
If it was
not for the entail I should not mind it."	29.1134
But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose that
Bingley was the person meant.	42.0065
At length the Parsonage was discernible.	49.6260
Elizabeth
was ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated
between Charlotte and Miss De Bourgh--the former of whom was engaged in
listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all
dinner time.	42.1376
Hurst."	121.2263
Who _could_ about such a nasty little freckled
thing?"	75.0746
The introduction
was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation--a
readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the
whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably,
when the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy and Bingley were
seen riding down the street.	92.6493
Are
you going much farther?"	181.5783
"She is a very good kind of girl, I believe.	28.7411
repeated Miss Bingley.	13.4434
The
wisest and the best of men, nay, the wisest and best of their actions,
may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a
joke."	76.2465
"Not at all."	29.5217
She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses
were engaged.	99.5522
"And _that_ is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his
friend, and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such a
part of London!	48.2164
He was my godfather, and excessively attached to me.	32.6971
I wonder he does not marry, to secure a
lasting convenience of that kind.	35.1894
"Dearest Jane!	40.6578
Now is your time.	44.7986
we talked and laughed so
loud, that any body might have heard us ten miles off!"	85.2796
Jane ran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed and
thanked them both, with alternate smiles and tears.	60.6887
Pray go to see them, with Sir William and Maria.	40.8868
It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy himself; but,
whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an expression of general
complaisance, and in all that he said, she heard an accent so far
removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions, as convinced her that
the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed, however
temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one day.	72.9767
Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of
his concern, at having been prevented by business.	57.4733
"I do not blame Jane," she continued, "for Jane would have got Mr.
Bingley, if she could.	22.9724
As soon as I get to town, I shall go to my brother, and make him
come home with me to Gracechurch Street, and then we may consult
together as to what is to be done."	39.5895

Transcriber's note:

Spelling and hyphen changes have been made so that there is consistency
within the book.	145.6960
But he is an ugly fellow!	50.2994
She is a handsome girl, about
fifteen or sixteen, and I understand highly accomplished.	50.3308
The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and
shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.	61.6196
